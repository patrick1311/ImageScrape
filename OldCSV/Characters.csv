Cyclops' body constantly absorbs ambient energy, such as sunlight,","Scott Summers was the first of two sons born to Major Christopher Summers, a test pilot for the U.S. Air Force, and his wife Katherine. Christopher was flying his family home from vacation when their plane was attacked by a spacecraft from the interstellar Shi'ar Empire. To save their lives, Katherine pushed Scott and his brother Alex out of the plane with the only available parachute. Scott suffered a head injury upon landing, thus forever preventing him from controlling his mutant power by himself. With their parents presumed dead, the authorities separated the two boys. Alex was adopted, but Scott remained comatose in a hospital for a year. On recovering, he was placed in an orphanage in Omaha, Nebraska that was secretly controlled by his future enemy, the evil geneticist Mister Sinister. As a teenager, Scott came into the foster care of Jack Winters, a mutant criminal known as the Jack O'Diamonds. After Scott began to suffer from severe headaches he was sent to a specialist who discovered that lenses made of ruby quartz corrected the problem. Soon after, Scott's mutant power first erupted from his eyes as an uncontrollable blast of optic force. The blast demolished a crane, causing it to drop its payload toward a terrified crowd. Scott saved lives by obliterating the object with another blast, but the bystanders believed that he had tried to kill them and rallied into an angry mob. Scott fled, escaping on a freight train. Winters sought to use Scott's new-found talent in his crimes, and physically abused the young boy when he initially refused. However, Scott's display of power had attracted the attention of the mutant telepath Professor Charles Xavier, who teamed up with F.B.I. agent Fred Duncan in their mutual attempt to find Scott. Scott was rescued from Winters' clutches and was enlisted by Xavier as the first member of the X-Men, a team of young mutants who trained to use their powers in the fight for human/mutant equality. As Cyclops, Scott became deputy leader of the X-Men. While he was a skilled tactician, his social skills were lacking. Scott had fallen in love with his teammate Jean Grey, but his reserved demeanor prevented him from expressing his feelings for her for years. When Xavier's other original recruits left the fold following an encounter with the sentient island-being Krakoa, Cyclops stayed on as deputy leader of the new team. Shortly thereafter, the cosmic entity known as the Phoenix Force took Jean's place. When it committed suicide, Scott believed the love of his life had died and he left the X-Men. During his time away from the team, Scott met fishing boat captain Lee Forrester who helped him work through his grief. Scott eventually returned to the X-Men whereupon he met Madelyne Pryor, a woman who bore an uncanny resemblance to Jean. Unaware that Madelyne was a clone of Jean created by Sinister, Scott fell in love with Madelyne and they were soon married. Madelyne fell pregnant and bore Scott a son named Nathan Christopher. When the real Jean emerged from suspended animation, Scott abandoned his wife and son and rejoined the other original X-Men in establishing a new team, X-Factor. During a demonic invasion of New York City, X-Factor and the X-Men fought against a super-powered and insane Madelyne. The invasion was thwarted after Madelyne perished in combat with Jean. Later, the mutant warlord named Apocalypse infected baby Nathan with a techno-organic virus. To save his son's life, Scott had to allow a member of the Clan Askani to transport Nathan two millennia into the future, where it had been foreseen that he would deliver the world from Apocalypse’s clutches. X-Factor disbanded soon after, and its members returned to the ranks of the X-Men. Scott and his long-time love Jean were married, and whilst on their honeymoon their spirits were taken into the time-stream by the Clan Askani’s matriarch. Arriving in the future, they inhabited new bodies and raised Nathan for twelve years. When they returned to their own time and bodies, Nathan remained in the future and ultimately matured into his time's greatest hero: Cable. Following Professor X's arrest for crimes committed as the evil psionic entity Onslaught, Scott assumed the role of leadership of the X-Men once more.

However, when his brother, David, was killed in action shortly after taking on the role of Starman, Jack was forced into taking up the cosmic rod in order to protect Opal City and bring his brother's killer to justice. Since then, he imperceptibly came to love his role as Opal's protector, and found that he enjoyed being a hero. Recently, he embarked on a year-long quest in space to find Will Payton, his girlfriend Sadie's brother and a former Starman. He was eventually successful in his quest, but did not bring Payton back to Earth since the latter discovered he may be the reincarnation of an alien prince. Jack agreed to be a member of the Justice Society after the mission to ensure Fate's reincarnation, but following events in Opal City which kept him away for some time, he reconsidered and become a reservist, called in when the group was in desperate need of additional firepower. Later still, following the death of his father, and Sadie's announcement that she was pregnant, he decided to step down from the heroic world altogether in order to rear his two children (the first having been sired without his knowledge when he was raped by the Mist), passing the cosmic rod onto Courtney Whitmore, the current Star-Spangled Kid.",,0

This event drove their father's alcoholism to a whole new level, and it ended up killing him. Guy always struggled with his anger and aggression and because of this demon he decided to use his career to help others with the same problem. Guy became a social caseworker and helped prison inmates. One of these inmates ended up being Hal Jordan. Hal was in the correctional facility because of an alcohol problem. This most likely resonated with Guy because of his own father. While Guy and Hal ware in prison during a huge prison riot, Guy lost his temper, and in a rage he attacked one of the inmates.

Following a short break-up after believing their mentor was dead, the X-Men reformed with two new members - the magnetism-manipulating Polaris and the plasma-charged Havok. Bobby had a brief romantic relationship with Polaris until she realized that her heart belonged to Havok. Bobby had trouble accepting her decision, which led to increased tension between himself and Havok. Eventually, Bobby quit the team for a short time to sort out his feelings. Later, when the sentient island-being known as Krakoa took Bobby and his team mates captive, Professor X assembled a second team of X-Men to rescue them. Soon after, most of the founding members left the team and Bobby began attending college on a scholarship. Eventually, he helped his former team mate Angel form the Champions of Los Angeles. When the Champions disbanded, Bobby went missing, and Angel teamed up with the costumed adventurer Spider-Man to find him. Bobby had been hypnotized by the Champions' enemy Rampage into donning his battle suit, and Angel and Spider-Man were forced to battle him. After Rampage was defeated, Bobby quit his life as a costumed adventurer and returned to college full time to study accounting. Later, Bobby was contacted by Professor X to assist in rescuing friends and family of the X-Men from the assassin known as Arcade. Along with other former X-Men Banshee, Polaris, and Havok, the ad-hoc team managed to free the hostages and Bobby finally came to accept Polaris' love for Havok. During a summer break from college Bobby went to visit his former X-Men teammate Beast and soon became involved with the loose-knit collection of costumed heroes known as the Defenders. Along with Beast and Angel, Bobby helped reorganize the team into a more formal and cohesive unit. The Defenders eventually disbanded when several of their members appeared to perish during a climactic battle. Soon after, Bobby joined the other founding X-Men to form X-Factor, an organization that intended to seek out and aid other mutants under the pretense of hunting down those perceived menaces to society. During his time with the team, the Asgardian trickster god Loki captured Bobby, hoping to use him to gain control over the Frost Giants. Loki enhanced Bobby's powers to such an extent that he was forced to wear a power-dampening belt that was originally created by the subversive organization known as The Right to cancel out his powers. Once able only to sheathe his own body in a protective coating of ice, Bobby found he could encase the entirety of the Empire State Building. With time, Bobby gained sufficient control over his augmented powers that he was able to stop using the inhibitor belt. Believing he had achieved his full potential, Bobby never attempted to push himself beyond his perceived limits. When Professor Xavier returned to Earth following an extended absence in outer space, Bobby and the other members of X-Factor rejoined the X-Men. Shortly thereafter, Bobby confronted former Cosmonaut Mikhail Rasputin, the reality-warping mutant brother of Bobby’s steel-skinned teammate Colossus. Rasputin forced Bobby into a form composed entirely of ice, affording the young mutant a glimpse into his true nature. Subsequently, Bobby began experimenting with his abilities - using ice to add mass to his slight frame, or lift himself high into the air without the benefit of his usual slides. Months later, the psychically incapacitated mutant telepath Emma Frost took mental possession of Bobby's body. Frost was able to activate the full extent of his powers, using his powers in ways Bobby had not thought possible until she was coaxed back into her own body by Professor X. With Frost's prodding, Iceman later learned to completely transform his body into its full ice state on his own. Frost later also showed Bobby that he could safely revert back to his human form after his ice form's chest had been shattered in battle. Bobby later took a leave of absence from the X-Men to spend more time with his father who had been injured by the grass roots anti-mutant movement the Friends of Humanity. He returned briefly to the X-Men to rescue mutant doctor Cecilia Reyes during the government-sponsored anti-mutant Operation: Zero Tolerance, after which he returned to his father's side. Two subsequent events served to shed further light on Iceman's untapped potential. To secure a new host body, the would-be conqueror Apocalypse sought to siphon the awesome energies of \"The Twelve\"" - mutants of incredible power",,0

Soon afterwards, he inherited the family company, Stark Industries, following the death of his parents.  Based upon his own cutting-edge designs, the company flourished, and he quickly amassed a considerable fortune. While visiting a war zone (originally Vietnam, although later stories placed it in the context of the first Gulf War), Stark was wounded and captured.  Pressed into service designing weapons for the enemy, he secretly worked to design a suit of power armor, which provided him with enhanced strength while also serving to keep him alive, protecting him from the shrapnel that had lodged in his heart.  Escaping his captors, Stark makes it back to American lines, rescuing a wounded US Air Force pilot, Jim Rhodes, along the way. After returning to the States, Stark begins to improve his armor designs, setting up the Iron Man alter-ego as his bodyguard while he begins his career as a superhero.  A founding member of the Avengers, Stark provides much of the material and technical support for the group, concealing his dual role as a member of the group even from the others.  As time goes by, however, Stark's personal life begins to threaten his career as Iron Man.  A dependency on alcohol leads to difficulties maintaining his business interests, problems exacerbated by attacks from business rivals Justin Hammer and Obadiah Stane.  Eventually, Stane's actions lead Stark to fall deeper into alcoholism, and he actually loses his company;  at the same time, James Rhodes, now a long-time friend, takes over the role of Iron Man.  Eventually, Stark is able to regain both his corporation and fortune, along with the use of the Iron Man identity, replacing a mentally unstable Rhodes and defeating Stane in combat. Having sworn to leave the business of arms manufacture, Stark moves proactively against uses of his armor technology for aggressive purposes, disarming both heroes and villains, and going so far as to oppose government and law enforcement groups.  Later, following health problems, he fakes his own death and places himself in suspended animation, while Rhodes again takes the Iron Man role, this time in the armored suit known as War Machine.  Although Stark does eventually recover, his deception alienates him from Rhodes. Following a conflict with his own temporarily sentient armor, Stark's heart is replaced with an artificial organ, fixing many of his health problems, but leading him to require periodic charging, just as in the earliest days of his armored breastplate.  Later on, he publicly reveals his identity as Iron Man, and accepts a position as Secretary of Defense, a role he fulfills through the events leading up to the Avengers being disbanded.  In the meantime, a self-administered exposure to the techno-organic Extremis virus leads to new abilities whereby he now carries certain portions of his armor control systems within his body, allowing him to control his suit remotely and interface with other electronic information systems, as well as increasing his reaction time and own ability to heal. Recently, Stark heads the government project to instate the Super-human Registration Act, leading to conflicts with several of his past allies.  The pro-Registration side ultimately triumphs in this struggle, and Stark is elevated to director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and head of the Initiative Project, dedicated to creating a roster of different teams, each serving as a government-trained and -licensed superhuman police force on a state-by-state basis.","Recovered alcoholic.",0

The King then struck a bargain with Valor, promising him life, if he would serve the Spanish flag.  Valor agreed under the condition that the flag would always represent the cause of justice.  Eventually, though, Spain disappointed, and Valor fled back to England.   He and Donna had a son, Justin, who took to the seas with him.  Justin, though, eventually was injured, forcing Valor to rethink his life.   He thus unmasked himself before King Charles and swore to disavow the pirate's life forever.

294,"Wonder Woman (DC)(Earth-1 - Pre Crisis)(01- Diana)","Diana Prince",1/16/294_20051121225343_char.jpg,,"This version of Wonder Woman might be said to have not existed, as well, and certainly a number of her adventures are properly assigned to Hippolyta, from a post-Crisis perspective. It is this version of Wonder Woman that went through the most profound changes.  She went from being a fairly bland (read: safe) version of herself that really had a lot in common with the animated Super Friends version.  She was all about super powers and kickin' ass, with just a pinch of her Amazonian legacy thrown in.  By the early-mid 70s, though, she had abandoned the uniform and powers entirely, and adopted a role much closer to a secret agent.  She studied with a martial arts expert, took a job as the proprietor of a hip clothing store, and wasn't seen for a couple of years in her Wonder Woman outfit.  This era drew criticism, though, so she regained her powers and went on a 2-year quest to be returned to active duty in the JLA.  No sooner had she endured her trials when the Wonder Woman title started telling Earth 2 Wonder Woman stories, in deference to the setting of the Wonder Woman TV show.  When the show, in its later seasons, returned to the present, the comic returned to Earth 1, and the newly-JLA-reinstated Wonder Woman. During the Crisis , Diana was thought to have been killed.  However, as the Pérez run would make clear, she hadn't been killed, but sent back in time. And this , out of all of Wonder Woman's adventures, is where it gets weird. Somehow, in a way not adequately explained, she wasn't just thrown back in time.  She was actually devolved to the day she'd been formed of clay.  In other words, the Crisis affected her in a way substantially differently than it did any other character in the DCU.  Wonder Woman II and Wonder Woman III are the same person, but neither has knowledge of the other.  We speak of \"reboots\"" frequently in assessing the history of comic books",,0

To improve his timing he studied the rhythm of time pieces and by practice he learned to synchronize each of his actions with the beat of the prison clock. By the end of his sentence he had developed an extraordinary sense of timing which he resolved to use to further his criminal career. He then adopted the colorful costume and alter ego of Chronos, the Time Thief. Clinton had acquired an unhealthy fascination with time and he developed a series of gimmick weapons and deathtraps based on time pieces (clocks with blades as hands, flying sun dials). Chronos made his debut in Ivy Town, but was defeated by the Atom. He next tried to steal a collection of historic Hungarian clocks, but was again defeated. The Atom has since thwarted all of Chronos plans. Each appearance or new crime prompted an evolution in Chronos's weaponry. His study of time led to more intricate and revolutionary inventions -- lenses that prevent people from seeing certain events (e.g. his getaway vehicle or another specific object), circuitry embedded in his costume that could control the local flow of time (freezing people in time or altering his own perception of time), and ultimately a fully functional time machine (before it and the designs were destroyed). One story suggested that Chronos may have been receiving help from a future version of himself, but it is unknown at what relative time frame that Chronos came from. Chronos eventually stopped stealing for his own gain and began stealing to finance his time research. The Atom had always thwarted Chronos, but he had decided to turn his back on humanity and had retreated to a peaceful seclusion with a group a six-inch tall aliens in the Amazonian jungle. Chronos had more success without the Atom, but he brought himself to the attention of the Blue Beetle (Ted Kord) when he tried to blackmail one of the employees of Kord Inc. He also fought the Beetle during Darkseid's anti-hero riots. During one struggle against the Beetle, Chronos was hurled 100 million years into the past where he encountered a time-lost Captain Atom. Upon his return to the present Chronos was able to use his technology to manipulate the money markets to amass a fortune, but old habits die hard, and Chronos's illegal endeavors were discovered and he was returned to prison. He was freed by the Calendar Man to work with the Time Foes, but was captured by the Team Titans. Out of desperation and humiliation, Chronos took a drastic chance -- he accepted an offer from the demon Neron and exchanged his soul for the metahuman ability to travel through time. However bargains with Neron are never fair and Chronos found that each journey through the timestream accelerated his ageing. A man who should have been a healthy adult became an aged senior citizen. All the experiments and Neron's \"gift\"" had taken a toll on Clinton's body and be began to loose touch with any sense of the \""now.\"" He had trouble staying localized in time and appeared to fade away into nothingness.

The wizard had the young prince brought before him, and ordered him to speak his name. Teth-Adam did so, and was transformed into Mighty-Adam, a superhero possessing the stamina of Shu, the swiftness of Heru (Horus), the strength of Amon, the wisdom of Zehuti, the power of Aton, and the courage of Mehen. Mighty-Adam served as Egypt's champion for many centuries, but became corrupted by the charms of a mysterious woman, revealed to be Shazam's evil daughter Blaze in disguise. Bewitched by Blaze, Adam became convinced that he and his mistress should rule the Egyptian kingdom, so he killed the Pharaoh and appointed himself ruler. Shazam was made aware of this treachery and, as a result, unleashed a powerful spell on Adam. The wizard extracted Mighty Adam's magic powers and encased them in a mystical scarab necklace, rendering Adam's de-powered body, now several hundred years old, into a withered corpse. Shazam then buried both the body and the scarab in the tomb of Rameses II, where he had planned for it to remain for all eternity.

373,"Jessica Campbell Jones (Marvel)",,373_20080116115446_char.jpg,"Flight, super strength, high resistance to injury.","Jessica Jones was a lonely Midtown High School student with a crush on fellow student Peter Parker (who would soon become the hero Spider-Man) and a fantasy fixation on the Human Torch. She was on a trip to Disney World with her family when her father, distracted by the backseat quarrel of her and her brother, lost control of their car in an accident with an army truck transporting unidentified experimental material, possibly radioactive, to which Jessica was exposed in the course of the accident. Her father, mother, and brother were killed, and Jessica sustained injuries that put her in a coma for months. While the Fantastic Four clashed with Galactus outside her hospital window, Jessica awoke from her coma; she was placed in a home for wayward children and later adopted by a family named Jones, whose name she took. Months after the accident, while running home from school in an emotionally distraught state, Jessica manifested superhuman powers as a result of the experimental material to which she had been exposed; her inexperienced flying led her to crash-land in the bay, where she was rescued by Thor. She soon realized that she had also gained superhuman strength. While testing her flight capabilities, she chanced upon and defeated the costumed criminal known as the Scorpion, in desperate straits not long after his first defeat by Spider-Man. Proclaimed a hero, Jessica soon took on the costumed identity of Jewel, beginning her heroic career less than three years after Spider-Man's debut. Little is known of Jessica's career as Jewel, but her activities were evidently not as high-profile as those of many of New York's other costumed heroes. Nevertheless, she remained active for around four years, befriending a handful of other heroes, until she came upon a riot provoked by the Purple Man. Using his pheromone powers to take control of her, the Purple Man directed her to attack the approaching police, then held her in his thrall for months, subjecting her to physical and mental humiliation in imagined retaliation for his defeats by other super heroes. Finally, in a fit of insane rage, he sent Jessica to Avengers Mansion hoping she would find and kill his nemesis, Daredevil. Jessica attacked the first hero she saw, the Scarlet Witch, an act that snapped her out of the Purple Man's control. Unprepared to explain her actions, she fled and was pursued by the Avengers, taking a powerful blow from the Vision. Ms. Marvel rescued her from further attack, but Jessica was rendered comatose and cared for in a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility until Phoenix of the X-Men telepathically helped her regain her faculties. After weeks of physical rehabilitation, she was offered the position of S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison to the Avengers, but Jessica felt that her experience had taught her that she was unsuited to the life of a costumed hero, and she gave up her Jewel identity. Moreover, she found that the Purple Man's mistreatment had left her emotionally unsure of herself, particularly in romantic endeavors. Details of Jessica's subsequent life are sparse, although it is known that she was involved in a string of relationships that ended badly, including one with S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Clay Quartermain. She also became close friends with Ms. Marvel, who would undergo her own share of trauma during her Avengers membership and afterward. At one point Jessica attempted to return to costumed action as the Knightress, but this period was brief. She eventually became a licensed private investigator and opened her own firm, Alias Investigations. Jessica's recent string of cases included a surveillance assignment involving a woman whose companion was revealed to be Captain America, who changed from his then-secret identity into costume before Jessica's video camera; when the woman whom he had been photographed with was slain, Jessica realized she had been set up. She was questioned by suspicious police officers but helped out of her predicament by the timely arrival of attorney Matt Murdock. Her investigation led to a fight with enforcer Man-Mountain Marko and the revelation that she had been expected to publicize the video with the intent of creating a scandal defaming Captain America and the US government. With the help of S.H.I.E.L.D., Jessica exposed the plot's mastermind, a man named Zoumas, and received the thanks of Captain America, who encouraged her to return to the heroic life. Jessica next investigated a deranged man claiming to be Avengers associate Rick Jones, who paranoically feared attack by the alien races in whose war the real Jones had intervened. Jessica managed to partially calm his madness and reunited him with his wife. She was then hired by J. Jonah Jameson in an effort to track Spider-Man, only to bilk the publisher by spending his money on charitable endeavors. An out-of-town case led her to help troubled teen Rebecca Cross, who had run away after encouraging people to believe she was a mutant out of rebellion against her town's oppressive atmosphere, but the case ended badly when Rebecca's aunt killed her unjustly accused father. When Daredevil's secret identity as Matt Murdock was exposed, Murdock hired Jessica and the hero-for-hire Luke Cage as bodyguards. This initially proved awkward as Jessica and Cage had had a brief fling which strained their friendship, but they soon resolved their difficulties. Jessica instead began dating Scott Lang, the Avenger known as Ant-Man, with whom she was set up by her friend Carol Danvers, formerly Ms. Marvel and now Warbird. She next found herself investigating the Mutant Growth Hormone trade, and teamed up with fellow superhuman investigator and ex-costumed heroine Jessica Drew to rescue Mattie Franklin, the young heroine formerly known as Spider-Woman, from being misused by the dealers. She also hired the dedicated but annoying young Malcolm Powder as a part-time assistant. When the Kingpin sent the insane assassin Typhoid Mary against Murdock, Jessica and Cage worked together against her, getting her on the ropes so that Murdock could deliver a blow to end the fight. Jessica's greatest challenge came when relatives of some of the Purple Man's victims asked her to confront the imprisoned villain about his many murders, several of them committed on whims, in hopes that he would give their families a sense of closure by confessing to his killings. She was greatly apprehensive about confronting her former tormentor, but being consoled by Cage, she agreed to visit the Purple Man in prison, only to receive no useful information from the psychopathic mind-controller. The Purple Man then escaped in the chaos caused by the breakout of fellow prisoner Carnage, and he sought out Jessica in order to again control her. When the Avengers arrived, he commanded Jessica to fight them, but she activated a psychic defense trigger left in her mind by Phoenix years earlier and defied him, knocking him out with one blow. In the aftermath of the confrontation, Jessica informed Ant-Man that she was pregnant with another man's child and the couple broke up. She instead moved in with Cage, the father, and the two began a long-term relationship. Jessica has since taken a position as a superhuman consultant with the Daily Bugle, working with reporter Ben Urich on stories related to New York's growing super hero population. After their daughter was born, Jessica and Luke were married in the company of their heroic friends.",,0

Jonah Jameson, Jr. (Marvel)",,388_20060504073417_char.jpg,,"The step-son of an abusive veteran, Jameson began his journalism career as a paperboy, then copy boy for the Daily Bugle, formerly edited by old man Jameson, whom some presume to have been his father. A sullen and bullying student, he quit school after becoming a reporter. At twenty he uncovered police corruption by supposed department hero Sam Kenner; beaten and bombed, Jameson nonetheless exposed Kenner with the help of Bugle owner William Goodman. He became a full-time Bugle reporter, including a stint as a war correspondent, criticizing most costumed heroes as glory-seeking vigilantes upstaging the common man. Marrying his high school sweetheart Joan, Jameson rose to editor-in-chief and became renowned for supporting civil rights and opposing organized crime. When Goodman's heirs put the Bugle up for sale, Jameson tapped his last dollar and made the newspaper his own. He worked hard to support his wife and their son John, eventually becoming a millionaire member in New York's elite Century Club; although earning a reputation as a notorious miser, he supported many charities and often helped employees in true need. Still a reporter at heart, he ventured to Korea for a story but was crushed when Joan was killed by a masked gunman in his absence; this and other self-perceived failures contributed to his distrust of masked heroes and the heroic ideal. In recent years, when the superhuman performer Spider-Man became a crimefighter, Jameson vowed to expose him as a publicity-seeking scofflaw, and not even the rescue of John from a space flight disaster dissuaded him. He relied on photos from Peter Parker, not knowing he was employing Spider-Man himself. Jameson heralded the Spacemen as superior heroes, but this gambit failed when Spider-Man exposed them as criminals; support for Mysterio yielded similar results. Despite his many achievements, Jameson's harsh self-analysis weighed upon him, for his hatred of Spider-Man was motivated by fear that he was indeed the selfless hero Jameson could never be. Jameson hired Dr. Farley Stillwell to mutate investigator Mac Gargan into the Scorpion to defeat Spider-Man, but the debacle left Stillwell dead and the insane Scorpion hating Jameson. Plagued by guilt, the publisher confessed his actions to his friend Norman Osborn. Scientist Spencer Smythe soon offered Jameson the first of many Spider-Slayer robots, with which he battled Spider-Man to a standstill before the web-slinger escaped. Jameson rallied New York against the Kingpin's crime wave; abducted for his insolence, he remained defiant before being rescued by Spider-Man. Months later, Osborn, the Green Goblin, seemingly died in battle with Spider-Man; Jameson suspected Spider-Man of outright murder, hiring Luke Cage to bring the wall-crawler in, but desisted when John became the Man-Wolf. Jameson's obsession paled before concern for his son, but his own safety became an issue when he was attacked by the Grizzly, a violent wrestler he had blacklisted a decade before. Spider-Man rescued Jameson but chided him for the grudge; in response, Jameson hired Daniel Berkhart to harass Spider-Man as Mysterio's supposed ghost. When this failed, he contracted Farley Stillwell's brother Harlan to mutate a new operative, but fugitive Rick Deacon usurped the process and became the criminal Fly, killing Stillwell and becoming an enemy of Spider-Man and Jameson alike. Jameson mysteriously received photos depicting Spider-Man with the body of Peter Parker; the photos, sent by Osborn's drug-maddened son Harry, were actually of a clone. Jonah nevertheless kept them quiet but stepped up his traditional campaigns. He approached Dr. Marla Madison to construct her own Spider-Slayer but met no better success. Finally confronting Parker, whom he imagined had been slain and replaced by Spider-Man, Jameson believed his story of faked photography. His relationship with Madison turned romantic, and he proved his principles anew by denouncing the terrorists of the People's Liberation Front. The PLF responded by hiring the Hitman, but even in the face of death Jameson ridiculed his abductors, who were defeated by Spider-Man and the Punisher. Meanwhile, Smythe, whose obsession had outgrown even Jameson's, learned he was dying and resolved to take Jameson and Spider-Man with him to the grave. He mesmerized the Man-Wolf into abducting Jameson and fighting Spider-Man; Jameson believed John dead when he saw his son teleported away. Smythe suddenly shackled Jonah and Spider-Man with a bomb, dying afterward. Jameson broke down, admitting his obsession had harmed him far more than its subject, but Spider-Man deactivated the bomb, leaving Jameson devastated at his confession. Scientist Jonas Harrow targeted Jonah, driving him mad, but his tenacity challenged even Harrow, and after being rescued by Spider-Man, Jameson was soon his typically paranoid self. Months later, John resurfaced alive, barely remembering his extradimensional adventures, and Jameson was overjoyed with his son's cure. Longtime colleague Ian Fate resurfaced as a sorcerer in the company of the monstrous Man-Thing; naively expecting Jameson to help reshape the world, Fate lashed out when refused, but while Spider-Man fought the Man-Thing, Jameson calmed Fate and set him on a more peaceful path. Jameson himself returned to basics by investigating waterfront extortion, interrogating no less than the Kingpin and risking his life to uncover the perpetrators, albeit with unexpected assistance from Spider-Man. Perhaps in unconscious gratitude, Jameson's subsequent scheme to discredit Spider-Man with impostors proved half-hearted at best. The Hobgoblin, secretly Jameson's Century Club crony Roderick Kingsley, learned Osborn's secrets and tried to blackmail Jameson over the Scorpion's mutation. Spider-Man ended this scheme, but the conscience-stricken Jameson publicly revealed his guilt anyway, then married Marla Madison. Soon afterward, he hired the alleged mutant hunters X-Factor and the mercenary Wild Pack to bring in Spider-Man but, more at peace than he had been in years, he seemed content to restrict his castigations to the printed page. However, his vendetta literally took new form when the Chameleon imprisoned and impersonated him, bringing anti-Spider-Man sentiments to new heights. Inevitably rescued by Spider-Man, he found a new crisis awaiting him, for Thomas Fireheart, secretly the mercenary Puma, acquired the Bugle to build up Spider-Man's reputation. Jameson sought solace in his lifelong convictions, denigrating neo-Nazi Eric Hartmann in print; when Hartmann's forces invaded the Bugle, for once Jameson played the rescuer when he downed Hartmann before the madman could shoot the intervening Spider-Man. Fireheart eventually returned the Bugle to Jameson, but his control was wrested away by Norman Osborn, alive after all, but Jameson nonetheless investigated the mutant-hunting Operation: Zero Tolerance. Hoping to placate the publisher, the android-human Bastion offered him the outlaw X-Men's secrets, but Jameson refused, as his distaste for prejudice outweighed even his dislike of costumed heroes. The X-Men defeated Bastion, but Jameson was scarcely short of enemies when Osborn hired Daniel Berkhart, who had joined Mysterio's cousin Maguire Beck in the identity of Mad Jack, to force Jameson to sell the Bugle. Soon afterward, when Venom was ordered to put a scare into him, the madman mistook his instructions for a kill order, and even Jameson winced at the beating Spider-Man took in his defense. Jameson regained the Bugle when Osborn went mad in a mystic ritual, which also empowered teenager Mattie Franklin, who became a new Spider-Woman and was, ironically, entrusted to the care of the Jamesons. A different legacy hounded Jameson as Spencer Smythe's even madder son Alistair threatened Jameson's family before receiving his latest defeat. Berkhart and Beck, now Mysterio and Mad Jack, abducted Jameson but were outwitted by Spider-Man and Daredevil. Unencumbered by gratitude, he sought to capitalize on the revelation of Daredevil's secret identity but was undercut when reporter Ben Urich refused to participate. Jameson hired superhuman investigator Jessica Jones to break a similar story on Spider-Man, but Jones merely put his money to work for charity, making her later rescue of Mattie from drug dealers all the more biting. Even Jameson began to face his vendetta's futility, and his invective grew sparse. After fresh humiliation in a libel trial, he agreed to a new Bugle feature with a theoretically objective focus on super heroes, co-managed by Urich and Jones, but he was stunned by seeming proof that his son John had, inexplicably, been Spider-Man all along. Jameson's hatred of Spider-Man can only intensify when he inevitably learns the truth. Resigned from being a mayor in Superior Spider-Man #31.",,0

Created by Robert Kanigher and Sheldon Moldoff, she first appeared in Batman #181 (June 1966).[1] Poison Ivy is depicted as one of the world's most prominent eco-terrorists. She is obsessed with plants, botany, and environmentalism. She uses toxins from plants and mind controlling pheromones for her criminal activities, which are usually aimed at protecting the natural environment. Fellow villain Harley Quinn became her recurring partner-in-crime and possibly her only human friend. She has proven to be one of Batman's more powerful foes, being one of the few members of his Rogues Gallery to display anything close to superpowers. Pamela Isley a.k.a. Poison Ivy has been portrayed as a love interest for Batman in some comics. In one comic, Ivy was robbing a charity gala Bruce Wayne was attending. Ivy's first kiss was poison, the second its antidote. When they first meet, Ivy's toxic lips planted a seed of toxic rapture in Bruce. But when she later kissed a dying Dark Knight, Ivy unknowingly cured her intended victim and established a budding romantic tension between them. Creator Robert Kanigher modeled Poison Ivy after Bettie Page, giving her the same haircut and Southern drawl as Page. In her first appearances in 1966, no origin was developed; she was merely a temptress. When she first arrived in Gotham City, her costume was a one-piece, strapless green bathing suit, covered with leaves. Leaves also formed her bracelets, necklace and crown. She wore green high heels and yellow-green nylon stockings with leaves painted on them. These particulars changed somewhat when she re-appeared. Poison Ivy was promoted after the rise of feminism pointed out the need for a greater number of more independent female villains in the series. She was also used to replace the increasingly sympathetic Catwoman as a clearly antagonistic female supervillain foil for Batman, and then made further appearances in the Batman comic book series and in Suicide Squad. The second, retconned origin story provided for her by Neil Gaiman in the late 1980s linked her to Swamp Thing and his original Black Orchid as a human-plant hybrid. She has since appeared in starring roles in Gotham City Sirens and Birds of Prey. In the 1997 film, Batman & Robin, she was portrayed by Uma Thurman. Poison Ivy has been featured in the television series, Batman: The Animated Series and The Batman, brought to life by voice actresses Diane Pershing and Piera Coppola respectively. She is significantly younger on The Batman than in any of her other incarnations – a teenager in fact, who nevertheless proves to be one of the most powerful criminals in the world. IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Poison Ivy as #64.[2] She was ranked 21st in Comics Buyer's Guide's \"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\"" list.[3] from Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_Ivy_(comics)"",,0

480,"Talia al Ghul (DC)",,1/22/480_20051203103259_char.jpg,,"Talia was the younger daughter of Ra's al Ghul, considered heir to his empire despite her independent streak. She entered Batman's life when he rescued her from Dr. Ebenezer Darkk, who had recently split from Ra's League of Assassins. After her rescue, she shot and killed the man who had affronted her father. Batman's arrival caught her attention, and after telling the Demon's Head of this heroic figure, began a relationship that mixed passion with betrayal, love with deceit, and left the Dark Knight with a son. The entire Dr. Darkk incident was considered a test for Batman, gauging his suitability to assume control of the league and run Ra's operation. Ra's had Robin kidnapped, then introduced himself to Batman in the Batcave, noting that his own daughter was kidnapped in the same way. Batman's investigation and rescue of the pair convinced Ra's that Batman was a suitable heir, but the Dark Knight rejected the offer of Talia and Ra's business. From the beginning, Talia found herself drawn to Batman despite their differing views of the world. His outright rejection of her father's offer, and subsequent efforts to dismantle the league, only seemed to encourage her own independence. When Batman and Ra's dueled in the desert, he was struck by a scorpion; as he lay dying under the blazing sun, she slipped him the antidote. Little has been recorded about her early years or even who her mother was. She was clearly well educated in the arts and sciences in addition to being trained in weaponry and martial arts. She never knew her older half sister, Nyssa Raatko, and seemed to have been raised in isolation, under a's watchful eye. Her mother, of mixed Asian and Arabic descent, met the Demon's Head at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. One account indicated that the woman's name was Melisande, and that she was killed by one of Ra's servants, Qayin. Another account left the woman nameless and said she died from a drug overdose. Over the next several years Talia would turn up in Batman's life as ally or opponent, as the situation dictated. He continued to acknowledge but resist the attraction between them. At one point Ra's ga sed Batman, and when he awoke the Dark Knight discovered that Ra's had performed a marriage ceremony for him and Talia. The marriage remained unconsummated at that point: The Caped Crusader escaped and refused to acknowledge the bond. At some later point they did finally admit their attraction and love, which resulted in another ceremony, followed by the birth of their son, Damian. However, he continued to reject Talia so Ra's had her betrothed, instead, to Bane. She rejected the international brute, and after Batman defeated him, Ra's agreed that he was unworthy of his \"only\"" daughter. Talia remained affectionate toward her \""detective\"" but gave up on thoughts of a life together. Instead",,0

Gerry Regan was the last European Ragman, as he, still named Jerzy Reganiewicz, fled to the United States after failing to protect the Jewish population from Nazi persecution. After settling down in Gotham City, Regan passed the mantle of Ragman to his son Rory. Rory Regan is a ragman, doing good in his community by buying used items from people who need money. The suit of rags that he wears was originally just a costume made from materials found around the rag shop he shared with his father, Rags'n'Tatters. Currently each of the patches in the suit is made from the soul of an evildoer that the Ragman had punished and absorbed. The absorption of these souls caused a problem for Rory at one point, when the evil souls hungered for murder and finally freed themselves of Ragman. It was only with the support of Batman and Regan's old friend, Rabbi Luria, that he regained control, though at the cost of Luria's life. Ragman's powers have increased since then. Currently, he can absorb souls into his costume. With each new soul added, a rag is added. He can call upon the souls in his costume to lend him their attributes or power. He is also a very proficient magic user. Judgment and Vengeance Ragman was active in destroying many of the demons invading Earth. This would earn him the wrath of the Diablos, a group of demons who style themselves after the Mafia. Wanting to gain revenge for demons lost during the Day of Judgment, they attack Ragman, injuring him and tearing off parts of his costume. They believe him to be dead but this is not true. Ragman is one of the members of the Shadowpact, a team that formed to confront the Spectre. During 'Infinite Crisis', Ragman and Nightshade are seen standing side by side as part of the line of superheroes defending Metropolis from attack from dozens of villains. Ragman is one of the few volunteers willing to take on the rampaging Spectre, who has decided that all magic is evil. During a planning sessions, he is taken aside by the Enchantress and given a mystical gun. She entrusts him with it, as it can kill her if she goes too far with her magic, a scenario she believes is all too possible. He tells her if she truly turns evil, his costume will take her. He then tries to kiss her, but his feelings are not returned and Enchantress even mocks him for it in front of the other heroes. Shadowpact Ragman, along with his teammates, was trapped inside a shield of solid blood that grew over the town of Riverrock, Wyoming. Ragman and the rest of the team spend a very short period of time inside the shield, but to due to magical after-effects, a full year passes outside. Various mystical heroes, such as Phantom Stranger and Rex the Wonder Dog keep watch outside the town's borders. While inside Riverrock, Rory met an evil counterpart of himself belonging to the supervillain group that had formed the shield, the Pentacle. His counterpart is named Bagman. He/it dresses in similar green garb, and can turn his body to goo and while in this form he absorbs people. While inside Bagman they either suffocate or they are digested. Bagman even mentioned how oddly similar the Shadowpact and the Pentacle are. Rory only survives this encounter because Bagman's boss does not want the heroes to be killed. After the Riverock encounter, Rory must deal with the severe disruption to his life, as everyone had thought he was dead. He, like most of the team, ends up having to find a new source of income, a place to stay and the oddity of encountering a memorial statue to the entire team. Rory was temporarily trapped in the limbo dimension of his own cloak. He met the soul of an ancient Centurion working off his crimes.

The three grew up as Homo Magi and witnessed the dawn of mankind.  Nimue cared for homo sapiens as she did for all other species, but Morgana liked to toy with them and pull them toward their baser instincts. A bit of Morgana rubbed off on Nimue when she cast a spell of seduction on Merlin, in which she taught him his magic in exchange for sexual favors. Merlin had the last laugh, though, as he succeeded in stripping her magic away from her.  Shortly thereafter, Morgana, now styling herself Morgaine LeFay, conquered Camelot, and Merlin's demon, Etrigan, who was summoned to stop Morgana, was left to wander, as did Nimue, occasionally crossing paths with him. She fled to China and became an adviser in the court of Kublai Khan, trading sexual favors for her passage.  She left him, repulsed that he exiled his beloved Fourth Consort after she was raped. In 1493, sh arrived in Spain and fell in love with a beautiful young lady, Marisol de Rios, who was burned at the stake for sodomy by the Inquisition.

She then went to France, where she was dubbed Madame de Xanadu for having come from Kublai Khan's palace.  She was a favorite of Marie Antoinette until a Tarot reading predicting the events of 1789. Denied access to her anti-aging potions while imprisoned in the Bastille, Madame Xanadu received a visit from Death, who was in an especially chipper mood, having just been at a party.  Madame Xanadu so amused Death with a creative interpretation of her own Tarot reading as involving living a long life, that Death declared that she would only take her if Nimue requested it, but left the anti-aging spells up to Nimue. She frequently crossed paths with the Phantom Stranger,.  She nearly fell in love with him, but ultimately found him too unfeeling, particularly after he stated that the French Revolution was an important step toward Kent Nelson's recovery of the Doctor Fate helmet and the necessity of the death of Mary Jane Kelly, who was Xanadu's friend (as were the other victims of Jack the Ripper, although she herself had long since abandoned prostitution), on the grounds that Jason Blood (Etrigan) had impregnanted her with a demonic child. Her desire for revenge on the Phantom Stranger over Mary's death inadvertently led to her causing Jim Corrigan to die and become the Spectre. She wandered for quite some time before deciding that she wanted to atone for her sins. She did so by helping those troubled with the supernatural. She has operated her fortune telling parlour out of Greenwich Village since the late 1930s. She however remained without any real magic might of her own, which has led her to manipulate various forces in order to gain power. Over the centuries Madame Xanadu developed herself as an advisor, and now Xanadu often meets clientele plagued by supernatural problems. Although she can advise them however, some force prevents her from directly interfering in solving their troubles. If one of her clients manages to conquer a supernatural force, she can contain that entity in jars within her fortune parlour to prevent it from causing any further trouble. When the Spectre was punished after his failures during the Crisis on Infinite Earths and the battle in Hell that soon followed, he and Jim Corrigan werre separated into two separate entities.  Madame Xanadu found Corrigan in an urn in a locker in Grand Central terminal and freed him.  She also found him an assistant in Kim Liang.  He then set up shop as a private investigator right above Xanadu's own shop.  She began an intimate relationship with the Spectre (she would undress and breathe him in as mist), although not Corrigan, who was having a chaste romance with Kim Liang.","She is blind currently in the DCU.

Komand'r is also a highly trained warrior possessing a variety of combat skills.","Komand'r was born the eldest child of Tamaran's royal family. The first princess born in over a hundred years, she should have been courted and showered with honors. On the day she was born the Citadel Empire attacked and destroyed the western Tamaranean city of Kysarr and killed three thousand citizens in her name. Though she was in no way at fault for what had happened Komand'r was for all time inextricably linked with the terrible day. To make matters worse, Komand'r was crippled by a childhood illness that left her unable to absorb ultraviolet radiation to fly as most Tamaraneans did. Because of Komand'r's naturally grim disposition, a stark contrast to the royal family's generally contented outlook, the subjects of Tamaran hated her. As a result, though first in the line of succession, she was denied her birthright to be the next Princess of Tamaran to maintain respect and prestige of the royal family. Her privileges, honors, and her royal style and dignity were transferred to her younger sister, Princess Koriand'r (who would later become known as Starfire). Inwardly, Komand'r's rage grew and her resentment turned to hatred for her planet, her people, her family, and lastly her younger sister who, in Komand'r's eyes, made the fateful mistake of being born. Komand'r's rivalry continued and intensified when she and her siblings were sent, per Tamaran's warlike custom, for warrior training with the Warlords of Okaara. Komand'r's true feeling were exposed, when during a sparring exercise she attempted to kill her sister, the Princess Koriand'r. As a result, she was expelled by the Warlords. Humiliated by her own transgression Komand'r swore vengeance and joined the Citadel, quickly rising through their ranks to become a warrior fighting against the forces of her own planet and, ultimately, her own family. Betrayal Komand'r later betrayed her planet with detailed information about Tamaran's defenses to the Citadel. They conquered Tamaran with ease, and the surrender conditions included the enslavement of Koriand'r. Koriand'r was never permitted to return, since that would mean the Citadel would devastate the planet for abrogating the treaty. Komand'r was her sister's master and made the most of her younger sister's bondage with years of horrific servitude and torture. When Kory killed one of her rapists, Komand'r decided to execute her as punishment, but not before the sisters were attacked and captured by the Psions. Psions, largely a species of sadistic scientists, performed a deadly experiment on both of the sisters to see just how much energy their Tamaranian bodies could absorb before exploding from the overload. During the procedure, Komand'r's forces attacked the Psion ship to rescue her and while the Psions were distracted, Kory broke free with the starbolts, destructive blasts of solar energy, which were a result of the experimentation. Against her better judgment she decided to free Komand'r, who was still absorbing energy. However, far from grateful, Komand'r struck her sister down with the same (but more intensified), power and had her restrained for later execution. Kory escaped and stole a space ship to planet Earth, where she met a young group of heroes and helped form the new Teen Titans. Infinite Crisis and aftermath Komand'r recently appeared in the Rann-Thanagar War limited series, during which she killed Hawkwoman in her pursuit of a New Tamaran. She formed an uneasy alliance with the surviving players of the War, in order to deal with more pressing concerns (Infinite Crisis). She was not seen during the Crisis itself, and has recently appeared in Hawkgirl and JSA Classified, attempting to kill Hawkman and Hawkgirl. The Hawks defeated Komand'r, after which Hawkman used Psion technology to strip the villain of her starbolt powers.",,0

The Ultimate universe Captain America is more politically and morally conservative than his mainstream Marvel universe counterpart and is more prone to violent solutions, frequently using small arms and explosives. His costume is mostly the same, except that his mask lacks the traditional wings on the side of his head and his shoulders sport American star emblems. The mask was modified into a helmet as of Ultimates 2. Rogers becomes one of the first members and field commander of the superhuman team the Ultimates, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s answer to post-human terrorism. He tries to adjust to life in the 21st century, although he longs for older times and values, spending much time with Bucky and Gail (now senior citizens) and going to WWII veterans' reunions. Rogers wears a Kevlar uniform and carries a shield of pure adamantium. He also dates Janet van Dyne, the Wasp, the estranged wife of former team member Henry Pym. A year later, it appears that Captain America repeatedly betrays the team, and S.H.I.E.L.D. places him in custody. The Black Widow is revealed as the traitor, aiding a coalition of countries invading America. When these invaders, who call themselves The Liberators appear to have defeated all American superheroes and effectively America itself, the Wasp frees him from his cell and they join the other few heroes as a resistance. After a pitched one-on-one battle with the Liberators' leader, Rogers kills him with his own weapon. Rogers is also a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant. In addition, his strength and recuperative abilities are remarkable, he has been shown bicep-curling 545 lb. In the Ultimate Universe, Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk as a result of his experiments to recreate the Super-Soldier serum. Despite the Hulk being one of the strongest characters in the Ultimate Universe, Rogers takes on the Hulk in hand-to-hand combat, knocking him down momentarily. The Ultimate Six, and several heroes and villains, are the results of trying to recreate the original formula. Rogers also defeats Henry Pym in melee combat while Pym is in his almost 60-foot tall Giant Man form, in retaliation for Pym having beaten the Wasp during a domestic dispute.",,0

Having been successfully given electrical abilities, Electro, as he now liked to be called, was sold into the service of the Kingpin of Crime, Wilson Fisk, in return for construction contracts for another of Hammer’s projects. Electro served Fisk willingly as an enforcer, and when Spider-Man broke into Fisk Tower, the Kingpin set his new acquisition the task of taking the intruder down, something Electro swiftly managed. Electro was subsequently present when Kingpin murdered Frederick Foswell, the underboss known as Mr. Big, for having supplied Spider-Man with information. When Spider-Man returned to the Tower a few days later to steal the surveillance footage showing Fisk’s crime, Electro and the Enforcers were sent to stop him. Initially dodging Electro’s blasts, Spider-Man then tricked his foe into stunning Ox, one of the Enforcers. After taking down the other two Enforcers, Spider-Man grappled with Electro, then threw him in to a stream of water coming from a broken water pipe, causing the electrical criminal to short out violently. He awoke three weeks later in hospital to find that the Kingpin had fled the country and F.B.I. agents waiting for him to wake so they could question him as to his reasons for being in the crime lord’s basement. Electro’s killed everyone in the room and fled, but he was swiftly recaptured by Captain America, Iron Man and the Black Widow. He was imprisoned in a secure S.H.I.E.L.D. facility alongside several other genetically modified criminals (Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, Kraven and Sandman), his powers blocked by a high-tech control collar, to be studied and interrogated by Hank Pym (Giant Man). After several months, Dr Octopus engineered a break out, and the group slaughtered their way to freedom, killing 35 S.H.I.E.L.D. agents on their way out. Their next move was a direct assault on S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Triskelion main base to capture Spider-Man, who had been moved there for his own protection. Octopus breached computer security to shut down the base’s defenses, then Electro overloaded both primary and back-up generators. The group entered and left equally swiftly with their objective. Spider-Man was coerced into working with them on as they launched an attack on the White House itself. Conventional forces fell before them in seconds, but their progress was halted on the front lawn outside the Oval Office by the arrival of the Ultimates. Electro attacked Thor, and their battle raged into the air; but Electro’s powers proved no match for the alleged God of Lightning, who soon won the day, and along with his teammates, Electro was returned to custody. Bolivar Trask hired Electro to test Eddie Brock and the Venom suit by leading him on a chase through Manhattan. Spider-man showed up, but was knocked unconscious, resulting in a battle between Venom and Electro for the life of the web-slinger. Although Venom defeated Electro, S.H.I.E.L.D. intervened before anything more could happen. Electro was then placed back into their custody.",,0

The Sensei was put in charge of the League afterwards, however he would prove just as disloyal as his predecessor, and The Sensei would eventually struggle with Ra's al Ghul for the control of the organization. For a time, the Sensei was possessed by the spirit called Jonah, who in Sensei's body was responsible for the murder of Boston Brand, who became Deadman after his death. After a struggle with Deadman and Rama Kushna, Jonah was destroyed and the Sensei resumed control of his body. For a brief time, the Sensei assumed leadership of the League of Assassins.

After Rose and Logan arrived at the Alberta mining camp (where they were taking refuge after fleeing Logan's childhood home), Logan soon met Cookie Malone, an overweight cook who was being accused of keeping extra rations for himself while leaving the rest of the camp hungry.  These accusations of selfishness became apparently well-founded when,  in two different points of the series, he is shown to be robbing people's homes. Logan first ran into Cookie as a teenager.  Logan was having trouble handling a cart full of stone after its wheel hit a bump in the downhill road he was on.  Cookie ran up the hill to help him, only to turn on him and dump the stones over the side of the hill.  Logan and Cookie would have more confrontations, with Cookie bullying a submissive Logan. Eventually, Logan became very popular at the camp and Cookie was jealous of the attention.  To get back at Logan, he cut the dynamite fuses short.  This resulted in the tragic deaths of some workers, not including Logan.  Logan was trapped under the rubble, but survived due to his healing factor.  During the funeral for the workers who weren't as fortunate as Logan, the Canucklehead himself caught Cookie robbing a home in the camp.  This was the first time Logan was violent towards Cookie, and from here the tables turned. At the end of the Origin series, there is a cage fight tournament at the local pub and both Cookie and Logan enter.  They meet each other in the semi-finals and, aided by a crooked gambler, Cookie opens the bout with a metal-knuckled punch to Logan's head.

She found such a man in industrialist Howard Stark. The two were married and they remained together until Howard's company, the Stark Defense Corporation, began suffering financially. This was due largely to Howard's investment in Biotech Armor, whose untested processes caused Stark's stock to plummet. Fearing for her future, Loni divorced Stark and took half of his assets in the settlement and then began sleeping with Zebediah Stane, Stark's chief competitor. Loni (being a gold digger) agreed with Stane in taking Stark's company apart (Howard was most likely too distracted as his second wife gave birth their son). Later, Loni had her and Stane's son. After Stane was sent to prison for kidnapping Stark's young son, Loni divorced Stane and acquired even more money from the settlement. Sometime later, she meets a teenage Tony Stark and his friend James Rhodes as well as seeing the younger Stark's prototype armor. She later pleaded with her ex-husband to provide Obadiah Stane (her son) with a secure education via a stay at the government think tank known as the Baxter Building. Later, Tony thinks it was Loni that's the mastermind behind the scenes trying to kill them and set off to Utah to find Loni. When they arrive, Obadiah falls off a cliff but Tony (in his prototype Iron Man armor) catches him as terrorists arrive on the scene. Tony flees, but follows them as they take Obadiah to Loni and their hideout. When Tony breaks into the compound, Loni floods it with poison gas trying to kill him, abandoning Obadiah. Stark saves Obadiah, but Howard and Nifara are taken captive by Loni. After killing Nifara and the guards (because she wanted no witnesses), Loni confesses to the elder Stark that all she ever wanted was power. That’s why she married Howard, divorced him, married Zebadiah, had Obadiah, and later had Zebadiah killed. Tony shows up, and Loni shoots Howard in the chest, threatening to shoot him again if he doesn't take the suit off. After Tony takes off his armor, Loni says she wondered what it was like if she stayed with Howard, had given him a child, and if she had been Tony's mother. Then, Loni shoots him in the head, not knowing that his entire body is a brain and will heal itself. Tony fights Loni, beats her, and tends to Howard.
