1,"Warren Ellis",1/13/1_20051119011757_creator.jpg,"Warren Ellis (born February 16, 1968) is a British author of comics, novels, and television, well known for his sarcastic personality and sociocultural commentaries, both through his online presence and his writing, as well as his use of extropian and transhumanist themes (most notably nanotechnology, cryonics, uploading, and human enhancement). He is a resident of Southend-on-Sea, England. Ellis was born in Essex in February 1968, about seventeen months before Neil Armstrong landed on the moon on July 20, 1969; he reports that the televised broadcast of the event is his earliest coherent memory. He was a student at The South East Essex Sixth Form College, commonly known as SEEVIC. He contributed comic work to the college magazine, Spike, along with Richard Easter, who also later followed a career in writing. Prior to his career as a writer he had \done most of the shitty jobs you can imagine; ran a bookstore, ran a pub, worked in bankruptcy, worked in a record shop, lifted compost bags for a living\. Ellis' writing career started in the British independent magazine Deadline with a six page short story in 1990. Other early works include a Judge Dredd short and a Doctor Who one-pager. His first ongoing work, Lazarus Churchyard appeared in Blast!, a short lived British magazine. By 1994 Ellis began working for Marvel Comics, where he took over the series Hellstorm with #12, which he wrote until its cancellation with #21. He also did some work on the Marvel 2099 imprint, most notably in a storyline where a futuristic Doctor Doom took over the United States. His most notable early Marvel work is a run on Excalibur, a superhero series set in Britain. He also wrote a four-issue arc of Thor called \Worldengine\, in which he dramatically revamped both the character and book. Ellis then started working for DC Comics, Caliber Comics, and Image Comics' Wildstorm studio, where he wrote the Genï¿½ï¿½ spin-off DV8 and took over Stormwatch, a previously action-oriented team book, which he gave a more idea- and character-driven flavor. He wrote issues #37-50 with artist Tom Raney, and the 11 issues of volume two with artist Bryan Hitch. He and Hitch followed that with the Stormwatch spinoff The Authority, a cinematic super-action series for which Ellis coined the term \widescreen comics.\ In 1997 Ellis started Transmetropolitan, a creator-owned series about an acerbic \gonzo\ journalist in a dystopian future America, co-created with artist Darick Robertson and published by DC's Helix imprint. When Helix was discontinued the following year, Transmetropolitan was shifted to the Vertigo imprint, and remained one of the most successful non-superhero comics DC was then publishing . Transmetropolitan ran for 60 issues (plus a few specials), ending in 2002. It remains Ellis' largest work to date. 1999 saw the launch of Planetary, another Wildstorm series by Ellis and John Cassaday, and Ellis' short run on the DC/Vertigo series Hellblazer. He left that series when DC announced, following the Columbine High School massacre, that it would not publish \Shoot\, a Hellblazer story about school shootings, although the story had been written and illustrated prior to the Columbine massacre.Planetary was notoriously plagued with delays, but it conclude in 2009 with issue #27. Ellis also returned to Marvel Comics, as part of the company's \Revolution\ event, to head the \Counter-X\ line of titles. This project was intended to revitalize the X-Men spinoff books Generation X, X-Man, and X-Force, but it was not successful, and Ellis stayed away from mainstream superhero comics for a time. In 2003 Ellis started Global Frequency, a 12-issue limited series for Wildstorm, and continued to produce work for various publishers, including DC, Avatar Comics, AiT/Planet Lar, Cliffhanger and Homage Comics. In 2004 Ellis came back to mainstream superhero comics. He took over Ultimate Fantastic Four and Iron Man for Marvel under a temporary exclusive work for hire contract. Toward the end of 2004, Ellis released the \Apparat Singles Group\, which he described as \An imaginary line of comics singles. Four imaginary first issues of imaginary series from an imaginary line of comics, even.\ The Apparat titles were published by Avatar but carried only the Apparat logo on the cover. In 2006 Ellis worked on Jack Cross (for DC), which was not well received and subsequently cancelled. For Marvel, he worked on Nextwave, which lasted 12 issues. The series was critically acclaimed and only ended because Ellis didn't want to carry on with it after twelve issues. He also worked on the Ultimate Galactus trilogy. Ellis also took over the Thunderbolts monthly title, which deals with the aftermath of the Marvel Civil War crossover In honor of the 20th anniversary of Marvel's New Universe in 2006, Ellis and illustrator Salvador Larroca created a new series that re-imagines the New Universe, under the title newuniversal. The first issue was released on December 6, 2006. Ellis continues to work on several projects for different publishers, including Fell (for Image), Desolation Jones (for DC/Wildstorm), , Blackgas (for Avatar Comics). Ellis also wrote an episode of Justice League Unlimited entitled \Dark Heart\. Ellis has managed a series of online forums and media to promote his written works and his creative ideals. These forums are sharply moderated by Ellis and his assistants, to suit the particular purpose each one was created for. They include the Warren Ellis Forum, DiePunyHumans.com, the Bad Signal mailing list, WarrenEllis.com, Warren-Ellis.livejournal.com and The-Engine.net. He is popularly known as \Stalin,\ \The Love Swami,\ or \Internet Jesus\ on these forums. Ellis' first prose novel, Crooked Little Vein, was published in the summer of 2007 by William Morrow (an imprint of HarperCollins), with a second novel, Listener, to follow. He is also developing a television series for AMC called Dead Channel, for which he will be the sole writer. It has recently been announced that he is writing an animated direct to DVD feature film, Castlevania: Dracula's Curse, which will be based on the similarly titled video game Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse. Ellis has described himself as \a notorious pain in the arse for getting involved in book design\ According to a comment made in the first issue of Fell, he has more trade paperbacks in print than anyone else in the American comic industry. Ellis is currently writing a column for the Suicide Girls website that appears every Sunday, entitled \The Sunday Hangover.\ Ellis is also writing a Second Life column for Reuters titled Second Life Sketches In Second Life he's known under the name Integral Danton. On July 29th 2007 Ellis announced two new projects for Avatar press; FreakAngels, a free long-form webcomic illustrated by Paul Duffield, and Ignition City, an ongoing monthly series.","Feb. 16,1968",0,

4,"Carlos Pacheco",4_20060911213920_creator.jpg,"In his early career, Carlos Pacheco did some work for Planeta Comics, an imprint of pan-European publisher Planeta De Agostini, mainly covers and pin-ups for Spanish translated editions of Marvel Comics, published at the time by Planeta. He later teamed up with writer Rafael Marin to create the Spanish superheroes Iberia Inc and Tríada Vértice for the same publisher. Pacheco first got attention in the United States for his work as penciller on Dark Guard, a 4-issue Marvel UK title where he worked with writer Dan Abnett and inker Oscar Jimenez. This led to him being offered work by American comic editors leading to Marvel Comics' 1994 Bishop four issue limited series where he worked with writer John Ostrander and inker Cam Smith. Later that year Pacheco did his first work for DC Comics on The Flash #93, 94 and 99, with writer Mark Waid and inker Jose Marzan Jr. After that Pacheco's next stateside work came in 1995's X-Universe two part limited series (a part of the Age of Apocalypse event), published by Marvel. Pacheco was joined by writer Terry Kavanagh and was again inked by Cam Smith. At the end of 1995 and the beginning of 1996 Pacheco and Smith collaborated with writer Warren Ellis on a Starjammers limited series. This series was successful enough that the creative team was reunited on Marvel's Excalibur ongoing series for a brief run in 1996. Shortly after this Pacheco became penciller on Marvel's Fantastic Four for two issues (#415-416), where he worked with writer Tom DeFalco as the title wrapped up in preparation for Heroes Reborn. By that point Pacheco's art had become a fan favorite, with his work regularly getting coverage in magazines such as Wizard. In early 1997 Marvel acknowledged this by assigning Pacheco to one of its flagship titles, X-Men, with #62 (March, 1997). On that title he worked with writers Scott Lobdell and Joe Kelly and inker Art Thibert. He left the title at #75 in May 1998. After X-Men, Pacheco began work on Avengers Forever a 12-issue limited series, where Pacheco worked with writer Kurt Busiek and (for the first time in the U.S.) inker Jesus Merino, who from that point on became Pacheco's regular inker. This series, which drew together many strands from various Avengers storylines to tell an epic adventure, was a critical, fan and commercial success. Pacheco's next regular assignment was in 2000, a return to the Fantastic Four, with Vol. 3 #35. This time he took on the co-writing chores (initially with Rafael Marin, later joined by Jeph Loeb) as well as pencilling duties. However Pacheco's pencilling contributions were shorter than expected, with his last art contribution coming in #50, and him leaving the book entirely by #54. While he was doing Fantastic Four Pacheco also wrote, again with co-writer Rafael Marin, a 4-issue Inhumans limited series, with pencils by Jose Ladronn and Jorge Lucas. His next substantial work after Fantastic Four was for DC Comics: JLA/JSA: Virtue and Vice, with writers David S. Goyer and Geoff Johns. This 100-page graphic novel united the Justice League and Justice Society against common foes in the style of what once had been an annual tradition. In 2003 Pacheco reunited with his Avengers Forever collaborator Kurt Busiek for the creator-owned fantasy war series Arrowsmith published by WildStorm. This series envisioned a world where magic is real and the First World War was fought with dragons, spells, vampires etc. used as weapons by both sides. The series ran for six issues and there are plans for future series set in that world which would again by written by Busiek and drawn by Pacheco. In 2004 Pacheco returned to super-heroes and DC Comics to pencil a five issue stint on the Superman/Batman title (\Absolute Power\, in #14-18), where he was again joined by writer Jeph Loeb. The two told a tale in which, due to the time-traveling machinations of the Legion of Super-Villains, Batman and Superman took over the world and a group of Freedom Fighters has to rise up against them. Later that year at DC, Pacheco went on to share alternate monthly pencilling duties with Ethan Van Sciver on the new Green Lantern series written by Geoff Johns. As of July 2006, he is once again working with Kurt Busiek on DC comics' Superman title. Busiek told readers of the Comic Bloc internet forum that Pacheco cannot draw 12 issues a year, and there will be fill-in artists.","November 14, 1961",0,"San Roque, Cadiz"

6,"Leah Moore",1/13/6_20051118060015_creator.jpg,"Leah Moore was born in Northampton, England to Alan and Phyllis Moore on the 4th of February, 1978. In 1990, at the age of twelve, she moved to Liverpool, where she met her future husband, John Reppion, just four years later, in 1994. Ten years after that, in October 2004, the two of them were married. Leah?s fascination with literature of all kinds led her to attend the University of Manchester, where she took a degree in Classics and English Literature. After that, her first published work was an 8-page story, ?King Solomon Pines,? with art by Sergio Aragones, in Tom Strong's Terrific Tales #5, in January 2003. This was soon followed by another 8-pager, ?Bad to the Bone,? drawn by Shawn McManus, in Tom Strong #19, in April 2003. After that, and with the encouragement of various people in the comics business, Leah and John Reppion co-write a proposal for a six-part series, which eventually became Wild Girl, with art by Shawn McManus and J. H. Williams III, published by Wildstorm Productions between November 2004 and April 2005. Based on Wild Girl, the pair were offered the opportunity to write a new series, Albion, due to debut from Wildstorm in June 2005. This is nothing short of a renaissance of many long-missing and well-loved characters from sixties and seventies British comics, and promises to be one of the most interesting comics to be seen in quite some time. The art is by Shane Oakley and George Freeman, with covers by Dave Gibbons, and is being co-written by Leah Moore and John Reppion, with plotting by Leah?s father, Alan Moore. As well as all this, Leah does a little illustration, having provided the original design for the cover of the Builth Balkan Crew CD, as well as providing illustrations to accompany some of her husband?s articles. She is also the pubic hair continuity advisor for Alan Moore and Melinda Gebbie?s Lost Girls, and provided articles for two books published in 2003 to mark the 50th birthday of her father.

7,"Jim Lee",1/4/7_20050924222652_creator.jpg,"Jim Lee (born August 11, 1964) is a Korean American comic book artist and publisher. He is known for his stylized, detailed and dynamic style. Some have called his work bombastic, but he remains one of the more popular artists in American comics. Lee was born in Seoul, South Korea, but grew up in the United States. Lee attended Princeton University and majored in psychology with the intention of becoming a medical doctor and graduated in 1986, but decided to pursue a career in comic book illustration instead. After inking one title (the book was Samurai Santa #1 and he only inked the cover) for a small, independent publisher, Lee found success at the largest North American comics publisher, Marvel Comics, as a penciller. His early Marvel work included Alpha Flight and Punisher War Journal. In 1989, he filled in for regular illustrator Marc Silvestri on Uncanny X-Men #248 and did another guest stint on issues 256 through 258. Lee became the series' regular penciller when Silvestri left in 1990. During his stint on Uncanny X-Men, Lee first worked with inker Scott Williams, who would become a long-time collaborator. Lee’s artwork quickly gained popularity in the eyes of enthusiastic fans, which allowed him to gain greater creative control of the franchise. In 1991, Lee helped launch a second X-Men series simply called X-Men, not only as the artist, but also as co-writer with long-time X-Men scribe Chris Claremont. Lee also designed new uniforms for characters such as Cyclops, Gambit, Jean Grey, Rogue, Psylocke and Storm, creating the images that an entire generation of X-Men readers would associate with the characters. X-Men #1 still is the best-selling comic book of all-time with sales of 8 million copies of the first issue, although multiple purchases of variant covers illustrated by Lee accounted for part of the sales frenzy. However, Lee ran into some creative hurdles. Claremont found it harder to work with Lee as their vision of the characters and storylines diverged. There was a prolonged power struggle over the future of the X-Men and in the end, Marvel X-Men editor Bob Harras favored the widly popular Lee, causing Claremont to depart the new X-Men series with issue 3. Despite this, Claremont and Lee later reunited on various projects and are reportedly on friendly terms. Claremont and Lee even engaged in a mutual interview for Wizard magazine in 1995. In 1992, Lee was one of seven artists who broke away from Marvel to form Image Comics. Lee's group of titles was christened Wildstorm Productions and published books such as Gen 13, Stormwatch, and Lee's pet title WildC.A.T.s, which was adapted into a short-lived cartoon series. Like most Image properties, these series were criticized for high levels of violence (although they were no more violent than the usual Marvel or DC comic at the time), excessive sexual references, and for emphasizing flashy art over storytelling. Despite such claims, Lee's stable of titles sold incredibly well, often exceeding a million copies per month in the early going, charting new highs in sales from an independent publisher. Lee and Rob Liefeld, another Marvel-illustator-turned-Image-founder, returned to Marvel in 1996 to participate in a reboot of several classic characters; the project was known as Heroes Reborn. While Liefeld reworked Captain America and The Avengers, Lee plotted Iron Man and wrote and illustrated The Fantastic Four. Lee managed to catapult Fantastic Four and Iron Man to the top of the sales charts, although fan reaction to this revamp of such well-known characters was mixed. Halfway through the project, Liefeld was fired from the project (poor sales - relative to Lee's output - were cited) and Lee's studio finished all four series. At the end of the one-year deal, Lee and Marvel agreed to hand the books over to other creators. Lee then concentrated in the Wildstorm line, attempting to break away from the stereotype of Image comics as all style and no substance by publishing critically acclaimed series' The Authority and Planetary. In publishing Alan Moore's America's Best Comics line, Wildstorm brought arguably the medium's most critically acclaimed writer back into mainstream publishing after almost a decade of independent work. Lee himself illustrated an original mini-series called Divine Right, in which an internet slacker inadvertently manages to download the secrets of the universe, and is thrown into a wild fantasy world. In late 1998, however, Lee left Image Comics and sold Wildstorm to DC Comics. Lee's career as a publisher had mostly precluded art jobs and he desired to return to his roots as an illustrator. In 2003 he collaborated on a 12 issue run on Batman with writer Jeph Loeb that became a runaway sales success (See Batman: Hush). This was followed by a year's stint on Superman, with writer Brian Azzarello. In 2005, Lee teamed with Frank Miller on the new series All Star Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder. Lee continues to run the company he founded, working side by side with new artists. Notable former WildStorm artists include J. Scott Campbell and Travis Charest. In July 2006, Jim Lee will return to WildC.A.T.s with Grant Morrison as the writer. Lee plans to pencil both WildC.A.T.s and All Star Batman and Robin, completed an issue of each every 6 weeks, as Lee claims he will not leave the Batman title until Frank Miller has finished his story.","August 11, 1964",0,"Seoul, South Korea"
10,"James Dale Robinson",10_20080802001226_creator.jpg,"James Dale Robinson, usually referred to as just \James Robinson\, is a British writer of comic books and screenplays and known for his interest in old collectibles and memorabilia. His most famous work is Starman, where he took a fairly obscure character and revitalized him to considerable critical acclaim. In 1997, Robinson's work on the title garnered him an Eisner Award, for the Best Serialized Story. He is also famous for his comic The Golden Age, which, despite being outside the normal DC universe continuity as an Elseworlds story, still established much of the backstory he would later use in Starman. He has also written the Batman book Legends of the Dark Knight, JSA, Hawkman, and his own creation Leave it to Chance, for which Robinson won two more Eisner Awards in 1997, for Best New Series and Best Title for Younger Readers. In addition to his work in comics, Robinson wrote the screenplay for the 2003 movie version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. This caused some controversy among fans of the original work, many of whom were disappointed that an established comics writer's take on Alan Moore's and Kevin O'Neill's series took so many liberties with and considerably changed the tone of the source material.","April 1, 1963",0,"Manchester, England, UK"

22,"Steve Yeowell",,"Having trained in 3D design (specialising in silversmithing and jewellery), Yeowell began drawing comics purely for pleasure, with no particular intention to become a professional artist. Having shown his portfolio to artist Bryan Talbot, he quickly found himself given work by Swiftsure (on the Lieutenant Fl'ff strip), Action Force, ThunderCats and Zoids comics. This last put him in touch with writer Grant Morrison, who then picked Yeowell to be the sole artist on new superhero strip Zenith, to run in 2000 AD beginning in 1987. Zenith was a popular success, running to four full-length series plus many one-offs. Yeowell was headhunted by American comics companies and has worked on Batman, The Fantastic Four, The Invisibles,[1] JSA and Starman. He continued his association with Morrison, collaborating on Sebastian O and The New Adventures of Hitler. Yeowell's work is noted for delicate penmanship and lifelike facial expressions, with a notable economy of style that means that his work suits both colour and monochrome treatment. He works with a dip pen (Gillot 404 nib) and a Windsor & Newton Series 7 No.3 sable brush, as well as Rotring and marker pens, on 220 g/m² Daler Rowney Heavyweight Cartridge Paper. The concentration on human features means that Yeowell's work is held to suit superhero, science fiction and historical genres equally.

It was after graduating and not really having any idea of what to do with himself outside of drawing, that he decided to try and continue in comics. In 1984 he created a tongue in cheek space opera “Quonto of the Star Corps” for the small press “Fantastic Fanzine”. Quonto was forgotten but the fanzine would later become Arrow Comics and lead to work on the comic series The Realm. After a few years at Arrow Comics, his work on The Realm would take him to Caliber Press and his first creator owned series; the Harvey Award nominated Baker Street. It was Baker Street that led him to DC/Vertigo and Sandman Mystery Theatre with Matt Wagner and Steve Seagle, and that collaboration would lead to many more projects and deadlines over the years to come. Since then he has worked for most of the major comic publishers along with providing numerous spot illos to the White Wolf roleplaying game series.

He also has a son, Jay, who is in 5th grade. While Kubert started at DC Comics, drawing Adam Strange and the Batman vs. Predator crossover, he is probably best known for his work at Marvel Comics, specifically the company's X-Men titles. An occasional cover artist on Uncanny X-Men (drawing the first cover appearance of the character Gambit) and X-Men Classic, Kubert later served as a fill-in penciller for Uncanny X-Men #279-280 and #288 before becoming the regular penciller on X-Men vol. 2 (starting with #14), following Jim Lee's departure from Marvel to form Image Comics. Both Adam and his brother, Andy, signed exclusive contracts to work for DC Comics in 2005. This came as somewhat of a shock to the industry as both the Kuberts (along with John Romita, Jr.) were known to be Marvel Comics' stalwarts, and the Kubert family was well known for its company loyalty. When Valiant Comics attempted to lure the two brothers from Marvel in 1994, they both refused, instead opting to keep their home at Marvel Comics. In a Wizard interview, the brothers made clear that they held no animosity for Marvel, but instead were excited for the chance to work on DC titles for a change.",,0,

52,"Joe Quesada",52_20051220183720_creator.jpg,"Quesada started out as an artist in the early 1990s. His first widely distributed works were for Valiant Comics where he penciled Ninjak and others. Later, he formed his own publishing company, Event Comics, and created Ash, a firefighter with superpowers. Eventually, Event Comics was contracted to do several books for Marvel Comics, dubbed Marvel Knights. Due to the success of this line, Joe Quesada ended up taking a more managerial role at Marvel, and became editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics in 2000. He also sits on the executive board of comic book charity A Commitment To Our Roots. Since becoming editor-in-chief, his artwork or scripts have often been extremely late, especially in the cases of Daredevil: Father and NYX; Quesada cited his other responsibilities as editor-in-chief as the reason for his work being so late, but he has still been heavily criticized for lateness. Joe Quesada is most well known as the editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics. He attained this position in 2000, replacing Bob Harras and becoming the first Hispanic editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics. As editor-in-chief of one of the two largest publishers in the comic book business, his decisions are very influential. He has been the subject of much praise, as well as much criticism. Quesada became editor-in-chief at the same time as Bill Jemas became president, but when Bill Jemas was fired, Quesada stayed on. Joe Quesada is credited with supervising Marvel Comics during a revival and a period of growth in which Marvel Comics recovered from the bankruptcy of the late 1990s. He restored Marvel Comics as the comic book industry leader in market share. He aggressively cut titles which did not sell. Throughout the 1990s, Marvel Comics was known for relying on its large stable of trademarked characters instead of hiring talented creators; Quesada shifted emphasis more toward hiring capable creators. Quesada oversaw the growth of Marvel as a major brand name in the entertainment industry outside of comics with such hit films as X-Men (2000) and Spider-Man (2002). Quesada has tried to turn Marvel Comics from being a solely comic book business to a general entertainment services business. Joe Quesada is known for disliking comic book deaths and imposing a moratorium on the resurrection of dead characters at the beginning of his tenure as editor-in-chief. His moratorium prevented writer Chris Claremont from being immediately able to resurrect Psylocke after her death in 2001. However, over time, this moratorium has been relaxed and more characters have been resurrected — Psylocke herself was resurrected in 2005. He has made recent comments[1] disavowing the rumors of a formal restriction on deaths (the \Dead Means Dead\ policy), when questioned about the recent returns of long-dead characters Colossus and Psylocke, saying instead that the rule for resurrecting dead characters was to examine the circumstances of that character's death and that such events must be story-necessitated, not simply used for higher sales numbers (i.e., as Psylocke's death was not, in his words, \a classic death,\ her resurrection was allowed to explore her further. Joss Whedon's return of Colossus, on the other hand, who had a very significant death - to stop the Legacy Virus - was deemed by Quesada to really \nail it,\ and thus be allowed under the latter reasoning). Joe Quesada also banned the use of editorial footnotes in comic books early in his tenure, though like the case with comic book deaths, this ban has since been somewhat relaxed. Joe Quesada disliked renumbered titles and restored the old numbering (implemented under Bob Harras's tenure) of Amazing Spider-Man, Avengers, and Fantastic Four. However, his tenure has also seen such relaunches as New Avengers.","December 1, 1962",0,"New York, New York"
54,"Dave Gibbons",54_20060516141214_creator.jpg,"Gibbons broke into British Comics by working on horror and action titles for both DC Thomson and IPC. When 2000 AD was set up, Gibbons was brought in as an Art Director. He also drew one of the original strips in “Prog1”, Harlem Heroes, as well as the occasional Future Shock. After the first year he began illustrating Dan Dare, a cherished project for Gibbons who had been a fan of the original series. He was also known, by sight but not by name, to readers of the short lived IPC title Tornado. Much as 2000 AD was \edited\ by the alien Tharg, Tornado was \edited\ by a superhero, Big E, who also worked on the magazine in his alter-ego, Percy Pilbeam. These characters appeared in photos within the comic, and both Big E and Pilbeam were portrayed by Gibbons for the entire 22 issue run of Tornado before it was subsumed into 2000 AD. After leaving 2000AD, Gibbons became the lead artist on Doctor Who Weekly/Monthly, drawing the main comic strip for most of the issues from #1 until #69. Gibbons was one of the British Comic talents identified by Len Wein in 1982 and was hired to draw Green Lantern for DC. He is best known in the US for collaborating with Alan Moore on the 12-issue limited series Watchmen, now one of the best-selling graphic novels of all time. Moore’s meditation on superheroes in an unsuperheroic age was perfectly completed by Gibbon’s precise and detailed art, usually drawn in a regular nine-grid pattern. Gibbons’ most recent complete work (2005) is a black and white graphic novel, The Originals, which he scripted as well as drew. Published by Vertigo, the work is set in the near future, but draws heavily on the imagery of the Mods and Rockers of the 1960s. His current projects include the DC Comics six-issue limited series The Rann/Thanagar War (which ties into the recently released seven-issue Infinite Crisis limited series) and Green Lantern Corps: Recharge. Gibbons also provides the cover artwork for Albion, the Wildstorm six-issue limited series plotted by Alan Moore and written by his daughter Leah and her husband.","April 14th, 1949",0,

98,"Stan 'The Man' Lee",98_20060311141509_creator.jpg,"Stan Lee (born Stanley Martin Lieber on December 28, 1921) is an American writer, editor, was the Chairman Emeritus of Marvel Comics, and memoirist. Though no longer officially connected to the company, save for the title of \Chairman Emeritus\, Stan Lee remains a visible face in the industry. With several artist co-creators, most notably Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, he co-created Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, and many other characters, introducing complex, naturalistic characters and a thoroughly shared universe into superhero comic books. He subsequently led the expansion of Marvel Comics from a small publishing house to a large multimedia corporation. Lee was born in New York City, New York, in the apartment of his Romanian-born Jewish immigrant parents, Celia (Solomon) and Jack Lieber. His father, trained as a dress cutter, worked only sporadically after the Great Depression, and the family moved further uptown to the cheaper Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights. When Lee was nine, his only sibling, brother Larry Lieber, was born. Lee attended DeWitt Clinton High School in The Bronx, where his family had moved next. A voracious reader who enjoyed writing as a teen, he worked such part-time jobs as writing obituaries for a news service and press releases for the National Tuberculosis Center; delivering sandwiches for the Jack May pharmacy to offices in Rockefeller Center; working as an office boy for a trouser manufacturer; ushering at the Rivoli Theater on Broadway; and selling subscriptions to the New York Herald Tribune newspaper. He graduated high school early, at age 16ï¿½ in 1939, and joined the WPA Federal Theatre Project. With the help of his uncle, Robbie Solomon, the brother-in-law of pulp magazine and comic-book publisher Martin Goodman, Lee became an assistant at the new Timely Comics division of Goodman's company. Timely, by the 1960s, would evolve into Marvel Comics. Lee, whose cousin Jean was Goodman's wife, was formally hired by Timely editor Joe Simon. Young Stanley Lieber's first published work, the text filler \Captain America Foils the Traitor's Revenge\ in Captain America Comics #3 (May 1941), used the pseudonym \Stan Lee\, which years later he would adopt as his legal name. Lee later explained in his autobiography and numerous other sources that he had intended to save his given name for more literary work. This initial story also introduced Captain America's trademark ricocheting shield-toss, which immediately became one of the character's signatures. He graduated from writing filler to actual comics with a backup feature, \'Headline' Hunter, Foreign Correspondent\, two issues later. Lee's first superhero co-creation was the Destroyer, in Mystic Comics #6 (Aug. 1941). Other characters he created during this period fans and historians call the Golden Age of comics include Jack Frost, debuting in USA Comics #1 (Aug. 1941), and Father Time, debuting in Captain America Comics #6 (Aug. 1941). When Simon and his creative partner Jack Kirby left late in 1941, following a dispute with Goodman, the 30-year-old publisher installed Lee, just under 19 years old, as interim editor. The youngster showed a knack for the business that led him to remain as the comic-book division's editor-in-chief, as well as art director for much of that time, until 1972, when he would succeed Goodman as publisher. Lee entered the U.S. Army in early 1942 and served stateside in the Signal Corps, writing manuals, training films, and slogans, and occasionally cartooning. His military classification, he says, was \playwright\; he adds that only nine men in the U.S. Army were given that title. Vincent Fago, editor of Timely's \animation comics\ section, which put out humor and funny animal comics, filled in until Lee returned from his World War II military service in 1945. In the mid-1950s, by which time the company was now generally known as Atlas Comics, a so-called \decency campaign\ led by psychiatrist Dr. Fredric Wertham and Senator Estes Kefauver blamed comic books for corrupting young readers with images of violence and sexuality. Comic-book companies responded by implementing strict internal regulations, and eventually adopted the stringent Comics Code. During this period, Lee wrote comics in various genres including romance, Westerns, humor, science fiction, medieval adventure, horror and suspense. By the end of the decade, Lee, by now living with his family in Hewlett Harbor, New York, on Long Island, had become dissatisfied with his career and considered quitting the field. In the late 1950s, DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz revived the superhero genre and experienced a significant success with its updated version of the Flash, and later with super-team the Justice League of America. In response, publisher Martin Goodman assigned Lee to create a new superhero team. Lee's wife urged him to experiment with stories he preferred, since he was planning on changing careers and had nothing to lose. Jack Kirby also suggested creating heroes with flaws, ones whose superpowers would not enable them to overcome personal problems such as relationships and money. Lee acted on that advice, giving his superheroes a flawed humanity, a change from the ideal archetypes that were typically written for pre-teens. His heroes could have bad tempers, melancholy fits, vanity, greed, etc. They bickered amongst themselves, worried about paying their bills and impressing girlfriends, and even were sometimes physically ill. Before him, most superheroes were idealistically perfect people with no serious, lasting problems: Superman was so powerful that nobody could harm him, and Batman was a billionaire in his secret identity. Lee's superheroes captured the imagination of teens and young adults who were part of the population spike known as the post World War II baby boom. Sales soared and Lee realized that he could have a meaningful and successful career in the medium after all. The first superhero group Lee and artist Jack Kirby created was the family the Fantastic Four. Its immediate popularity led Lee and Marvel's illustrators to produce a cavalcade of new titles. With Kirby, Lee created the Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, the Mighty Thor and the X-Men; with Bill Everett, Daredevil; and with Steve Ditko, Doctor Strange and Marvel's most successful character, Spider-Man. He is also credited along with Kirby with the creation of the Silver Surfer. Stan Lee's Marvel revolution extended beyond the characters and storylines to the way in which comic books engaged the readership and built a sense of community between fans and creators. Lee introduced the practice of including a credit panel on the splash page of each story, naming not just the writer and penciller but also the inker and letterer. Regular news about Marvel staff members and upcoming storylines was presented on the Bullpen Bulletins page, which (like the letter columns that appeared in each title) was written in a friendly, chatty style. Throughout the 1960s, Lee scripted, art-directed, and edited most of Marvel's series; moderated the letters pages; wrote a monthly column called \Stan's Soapbox\; and wrote endless promotional copy, often signing off with his trademark phrase, \Excelsior!\ (which is also the New York state motto). To maintain his taxing workload yet still meet deadlines, he used a system that was used previously by various comic-book studios, but due to Lee's success with it, became known as the \Marvel Method\ or \Marvel style\ of comic-book creation. Typically, Lee would brainstorm a story with the artist and then prepare a brief synopsis rather than a full script. Based on the synopsis, the artist would fill the allotted number of pages by determining and drawing the panel-to-panel storytelling. After the artist turned in penciled pages, Lee would write the word balloons and captions, and then oversee the lettering and coloring. In effect, the artists were co-plotters, whose collaborative first drafts Lee built upon. Because of this system, the exact division of creative credits on Lee's comics has been disputed, especially in cases of comics drawn by Kirby and Ditko. Although Lee has always effusively praised the Marvel artists, some historians argue that their contribution was greater than for which they are given credit. The dispute with Ditko over Spider-Man has sometimes been acrimonious, although he and Lee are formally credited as co-creators in the credits of the 2000s Spider-Man films. In 1971, Lee indirectly reformed the Comics Code. The US Department of Health, Education and Welfare asked Lee to write a story about the dangers of drugs and Lee wrote a story in which Spider-Man's best friend becomes addicted to pills. The three-part story was slated to be published in Amazing Spider-Man #96-98, but the Comics Code Authority refused it because it depicted drug use; the story context was considered irrelevant. With his publisher's approval, Lee published the comics without the CCA seal. The comics sold well and Marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts. The CCA subsequently loosened the Code to permit negative depictions of drugs, among other new freedoms. Lee also supported using comic books to provide some measure of social commentary about the real world, often dealing with racism and bigotry. \Stan's Soapbox,\ besides promoting an upcoming comic book project, also addressed issues of discrimination, intolerance or prejudice. In addition, Lee took to using sophisticated vocabulary for the stories' dialogue to encourage readers to learn new words. Lee has justified this by saying \If a kid has to go to a dictionary, that's not the worst thing that could happen.\ In later years, Lee became a figurehead and public face for Marvel Comics. He made appearances at comic book conventions around America, lecturing at colleges and participating in panel discussions. He moved to California in 1981 to develop Marvel's TV and movie properties. He has been an executive producer for, and has made cameo appearances in Marvel film adaptations and other movies. Lee was befriended by a former lawyer named Peter Paul, who supervised the negotiation of a non-exclusive contract with Marvel Comics for the first time in Lee's lifetime employment with Marvel. This enabled Paul and Lee to start a new Internet-based superhero creation, production and marketing studio, Stan Lee Media, in 1998. It grew to 165 people and went public, but near the end of 2000, investigators discovered illegal stock manipulation by Paul and corporate officer Stephan Gordon. Stan Lee Media filed for bankruptcy in February 2001, and Paul fled to Sï¿½o Paulo, Brazil. He was extradited back to the U.S., and pled guilty to violating SEC Rule 10b-5 in connection with trading of his stock in Stan Lee Media. Lee was never implicated in the scheme. Lee created the risquï¿½ animated superhero series Stripperella for Spike TV. In 2004, he announced plans to collaborate with Hugh Hefner on a similar superhero cartoon featuring Playboy Playmates. He also announced a superhero program that would feature Ringo Starr, the former Beatle, as the lead character.  Additionally, in August of that year, Lee announced the launch of Stan Lee's Sunday Comics, hosted by Komikwerks.com, where monthly subscribers could read a new, updated comic and \Stan's Soapbox\ every Sunday. The column has not been updated since Feb. 15, 2005. In 2005, Lee, Gill Champion and Arthur Lieberman formed POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment to develop film, television and video game properties. The first film produced by POW! was the TV movie Lightspeed (also advertised as Stan Lee's Lightspeed), which aired on the Sci Fi Channel on July 26, 2006. POW! president and CEO Champion said in 2005 that Lee was creating a new superhero, Foreverman, for a Paramount Pictures movie, in tandem with producer Robert Evans and Idiom Films, with Peter Briggs hired to collaborate with Lee on the screenplay. Lee in 2005 filed a lawsuit against Marvel for his unpaid share of profits from Marvel movies, winning a settlement of more than $10 million. Marvel, in 2006, commemorated Lee's 65 years with the company by publishing a series of one-shot comics starring Lee himself meeting and interacting with many of his creations, including Spider-Man, Dr. Strange, The Thing, Silver Surfer and Dr. Doom. These comics also featured short pieces by such comics creators as Joss Whedon and Fred Hembeck, as well as reprints of classic Lee-written adventures. In 2007, POW! Entertainment started a series of direct-to-DVD animated films under the Stan Lee Presents banner. Each film focuses on a new superhero, created by Stan Lee for the series. The first two releases were Mosaic and The Condor. In June 2007, Walt Disney Studios entered into an exclusive multi-year first look deal with Stan Lee and POW! Entertainment. \It's like the realization of a dream. Ever since I was a young boy, Disney represented the best and most exciting film fare to me. ... I look forward with indescribable enthusiasm to being a part of that world and contributing whatever I can to keep the legend alive and growing,\ said Lee.","December 28th, 1921",0,"New York City, New York, USA"

His father, a garment-factory worker, was a Conservative Jew, and Jacob attended Hebrew school. Jacob's one sibling, a brother five years younger, predeceased him. After a rough-and-tumble childhood with much fighting among the kind of kid gangs he would render more heroically in his future comics, Kirby enrolled at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, at what he said was age 14, leaving after a week. \I wasn't the kind of student that Pratt was looking for. They wanted people who would work on something forever. I didn't want to work on any project forever. I intended to get things done.\1 Essentially self-taught, Kirby cited among his influences the comic strip artists Alex Raymond and Milt Caniff. Kirby joined the Lincoln Newspaper Syndicate in 1936, working there on newspaper comic strips and on single-panel advice cartoons such as Your Health Comes First (under the pseudonym \Jack Curtiss\). Kirby remained until the firm went out of business in 1938, then worked for the movie animation company Fleischer Studios as an \in-betweener\, an artist who fills in the action between major-movement frames, on Popeye cartoons. \I went from Lincoln to Fleischer,\ he recalled. \From Fleischer I had to get out in a hurry because I couldn't take that kind of thing,\ describing it as \a factory in a sense, like my father's factory. They were manufacturing pictures.\2 Around this time, \I began to see the first comic books appear.\2 The first American comic books were reprints of newspaper comic strips; soon, these tabloid-size, 10-inch by 15-inch \comic books\ began to include original material in comic-strip form. Kirby began writing and drawing such material for the comic book packager Eisner & Iger, one of a handful of firms creating comics on demand for publishers. Through that company, Kirby did what he remembers as his first comic book work, for Wild Boy Magazine.3 This was followed by such strips as the science fiction adventure The Diary of Dr. Hayward (under the pseudonym \Curt Davis\), the modern-West crimefighter strip Wilton of the West (as \Fred Sande\), the swashbuckler strip \The Count of Monte Cristo\ (as Jack Curtiss), and the humor strips Abdul Jones (as \Ted Grey)\ and Socko the Seadog (as \Teddy\), for Jumbo Comics and other Eisner-Iger clients. Kirby moved on to comic book publisher and newspaper syndicator Fox Feature Syndicate, earning a then quite-reasonable $15 a week salary. He began exploring superhero narrative with the comic strip The Blue Beetle (January–March 1940), starring a character created by Chuck Cuidera4 in Mystery Men Comics #1 under the pseudonym, \Charles Nicholas\, which Kirby retained.","August 29, 1917",0,"New York City, NY"
102,"Geoff Johns",102_20140421003057_creator.jpg,"Geoff Johns (born January 25, 1973 in Detroit, Michigan) is an American writer of comic books. He graduated from Clarkston High School in 1991 and from Michigan State University in 1995. Johns has written issues of The Avengers, JSA, The Flash, Teen Titans, Hawkman, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern: Rebirth. Johns is also the writer of the current DC Comics event Infinite Crisis. This event, the sequel to 1985's Crisis on Infinite Earths, will significantly alter the status-quo of the DCU. Johns started out as a somewhat cult writer on Flash, before reaching stardom through Rebirth and his Titans relaunch. In 2000, he replaced James Robinson as David Goyer's co-writer on JSA. In 2003, with issue #51, Goyer left the title, and Johns has written it solo ever since. While in DC, he is known for creating Stargirl and a new version of the character Zoom for the current Flash. As of 2005, Johns shares a writing studio with Jeph Loeb and Allan Heinberg. Heinberg and Johns recently finished a JLA arc that bridged the aftermath of the miniseries Identity Crisis to the beginnings of Infinite Crisis. He also completed his five year run on Flash with issue #225. Johns is currently co-writing the Blade television series with David Goyer for Spike TV. In the summer of 2005, Johns and other prominent DC Universe writers Grant Morrison, Mark Waid, Greg Rucka, and Keith Giffen played a heavy editorial role in guiding the DC Universe after the events of Infinite Crisis. Among other projects, the writers will be contributing to a weekly series called 52 that is to last for one year and cover the events that take place between the last issue of the Infinite Crisis mini-series and the issues of all DC Universe titles the following month that will now be set one year later. In December 2005, Wizard magazine named Johns its \Man of the Year\ for his creative writing and editing work on DCU's Infinite Crisis. Johns based his Stargirl character Courtney Whitmore on his sister Courtney, who died in a plane crash in July 1996.","January 25, 1973",0,"Detroit, Michigan"
103,"Keith Ian Giffen",103_20060813110827_creator.jpg,"Giffen was born in Queens, New York City. He is best-known for his long runs illustrating and later writing the futuristic superhero team book Legion of Super-Heroes in the 1980s and 1990s, and for co-creating the humorous, international version of the Justice League in the late 1980s (which he later revisited in \Formerly Known as The Justice League\, calling them The Super Buddies). He also created the alien mercenary Lobo (with Roger Slifer), and the irreverent \want-to-be\ hero, Ambush Bug. Giffen's first published work was \The Sword and The Star\, a black and white series with writer Bill Mantlo. He has worked on titles (owned by several different companies) including Woodgod, All Star Comics, Doctor Fate, Drax the Destroyer, Heckler, Nick Fury's Howling Commandos, Reign of the Zodiac, Suicide Squad, Trencher (to be re-released in a collected edition by Boom! Studios.), T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents, and Vext. He was also responsible for the English adaptation of the Battle Royale and Ikki Tousen manga, as well as creating \I Luv Halloween\ for Tokyopop. He also worked for Dark Horse from 1994-95 on their Comics Greatest World/Dark Horse Heroes line, as the writer of two short lived series, Division 13 and co-author, with Lovern Kindzierski, of Agents of Law. He took a break from the comic industry for several years, working on storyboards for television and film, including shows such as The Real Ghostbusters and Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy. He and his Justice League cohorts (J.M. DeMatteis and Kevin Maguire) have recently unleashed their particular brand of storytelling on a title that he drew in the 1970s, Marvel Comics' The Defenders. The same trio produced more superhero humor in the 3-issue mini-series Hero Squared for Boom! Studios, and the 2-issue mini-series Planetary Brigade. Keith Giffen was the breakdown artist on the DC Comic book 52, a weekly series following in the wake of the Infinite Crisis crossover (written by Geoff Johns, Greg Rucka, Mark Waid and Grant Morrison). He continued in that role with the follow-up weekly series Countdown (DC Comics). He is also the lead writer for Marvel comics's Annihilation event, having written the one-shot prologue, the lead-in stories in Thanos and Drax, the Silver Surfer as well as the main six issues mini-series. Giffen remains a prolific creator of independent comics. Between 2005 and 2007 he's co-created and often authored or co-authored such books as 10, Tag and Hero Squared for Boom! Studios for Zapt! and I Luv Halloween for TOKYOPOP, Common Foe and Tabula Rasa for Desperado Publishing/Image Comics and Grunts for Arcana. Many of these were co-authored with his frequent collaborator Shannon Denton. Giffen's art has taken on many styles over the years. His early work tended towards a heavy influence from Jack Kirby. After an early stint at Marvel, he began doing layouts for artist Wally Wood during the late 1970s revival of the Justice Society of America. When he returned to comics after a hiatus, his style was more precise and reminiscent of George Perez and Jim Starlin and helped make Legion of Super-Heroes DC's second most popular comic after George Perez's New Teen Titans. It was his work on the Legion that rocketed him to comic book artist fame and gave him a creative control with the national companies that few artists achieved. He peppered his artwork with in-jokes such as upside down Superman logos, hidden Marvel characters, and eyeball creatures, and created an alternate futuristic alphabet in which he scrawled humorous messages on signs in the background of his panels. As his style loosened up, he found himself drawn to the work of José Muñoz. Soon thereafter he developed a scratchier, more impressionistic style, using a highly stlylized method of drawing directly with ink on titles such as Trencher and Lobo. After his lengthy sabbatical from comics work, Giffen returned with a style that some said was influenced by his Justice League artist Kevin Maguire that was mid-way between the tight, controlled pencils of his early Legion days and the freer but less anatomically correct style he had later adopted. For many years, Giffen would co-write comics, but only as a plotter. He relied on others such as Robert Loren Fleming to supply dialogue, even when he was basically the author of the work. He co-wrote the Freak Force series with Erik Larsen, and also co-wrote two Superpatriot mini-series. Beginning with Trencher, Giffen started writing comics fully by himself, although he still collaborates when the project calls for it. Giffen is known for having an unorthodox writing style, often using characters in ways not seen before. His dialogue is usually characterized by a biting wit that is seen as much less zany than dialogue provided by longtime collaborators DeMatteis and Robert Loren Fleming. That approach has brought him both criticism and admiration, as perhaps best illustrated by the mixed (although commercially rather successful) response to his work in DC Comics' Justice League International. His work on the 2001 version of Suicide Squad was not nearly as successful, however, and his loose, largely satirical style is arguably a detriment to both the English version of the Battle Royale manga and to the third version of the Defenders, published in 2005-2006. Giffen is known for his humorous takes on existing characters, often focusing on their personality clashes. He also has a tendency to poke fun at trends in comic books or character archetypes. His Ambush Bug miniseries is especially noted for its in-jokes such as Villian the Villain, Cheeks the Toy Wonder, and the use of DC editor Julius Schwartz as a character. He is also known for sudden plot twists and abrupt often tragic turns of fate. During his late 1980s-early 1990s run on the Legion of Super-Heroes light comical issues were often followed by darker ones where popular characters were maimed or killed. n February of 1986 Mark Burbey published \The Trouble With Keith Giffen\ in The Comics Journal #105, an examination of recent dramatic changes in Keith Giffen's drawing style. Giffen, Burbey pointed out, had changed from a slick, clean Jim Starlin style to an avant garde, heavily inked one. However, critics and fans largely agreed that this new style suited the strange and funny projects in which was involved. In the article, Burbey displayed several panels side by side to illustrate his allegation that Giffen was copying, or \swiping\ the work of Jose Muñoz. In response, Giffen parodied himself by alluding to the controversy by drawing Ambush Bug with the appearance of Snoopy in Son of Ambush Bug #5. Robert Loren Fleming wrote the panels for it. Loyal Giffen fans defended him by arguing that Giffen had actually ghosted the Munoz work, with some of the most extreme maintaining that in fact Munoz was simply a Giffen pseudonym, prompting two different men, each claiming to be Munoz, to launch competing defamation lawsuits against both Giffen and his fans (James Branch, \Who Knows Munoz?\, The Comic Book Companion, March 1987). However, Giffen himself acknowledges Munoz' influence, referring to the incident by saying: \I had a bad incident with studying somebody's work very closely at one point and I resolved never, ever to do it again. I can get so immersed in somebody's work that I start turning into a Xerox machine and it's not good.... There was no time I was sitting there tracing or copying, no. Duplicating, pulling out of memory and putting down on paper after intense study, absolutely\ (Keith Giffen Interview, Interviewed by Jon B. Cooke, Jack Kirby Collector #29). At this point in his career, Giffen was considered one of the most popular comic book artists in the industry, along with artists such as John Byrne, George Perez, and Frank Miller. The ensuing controversy hurt Giffen's reputation with those who knew about it. Although comic book artists such as Byrne and Rich Buckler have engaged in swiping with the knowledge of the comic book publishers, their swiping usually involved copying panels from artwork previously published, and owned, by their publisher. Giffen allegedly swiped from work for which the publisher did not have the copyright. However, DC Comics loyally protected him. They removed him as prime artist on his run of DC titles, such as Ambush Bug, and gave him full-time writing duties on Justice League until the controversy was largely forgotten and a new generation of comic book fans came to discover his work. He returned to drawing full time two years later while continuing to plot the Justice League and its numerous spin-offs. This period also marked Ambush Bug's end as a growing and popular major character at DC. According to Giffen, it had to do with editorial discomfort with the series' humorous approach to the DC Universe: \DC was just too uncomfortable with the (admittedly nicely selling) bully pulpit they'd provided the loose cannons on the creative team\.","30 November 1952",0,

111,"Bill Finger",,"Finger was a writer who best remembered (though never officially credited) as the co-creator of Batman with artist Bob Kane. Finger and Bob Kane began to collaborate in 1938. In early 1939, the success of Superman in Action Comics prompted editors at the comic book division of National Publications (later DC Comics, now a subsidiary of Time Warner) to request more superheroes for their titles. Kane subsquently created a character called \Birdman\. Finger offered such suggestions as renaming the character \Batman\, giving the character a cowl instead of a simple domino mask, giving him a cape instead of wings, giving him gloves, and removing bright red sections of the original costume. Finger wrote the first Batman story, while Kane provided art. Because Kane had already submitted the proposal for a Batman character to his editors at DC Comics, Kane was the only person given official credit at the time for the creation of Batman. Batman was a breakout hit, and soon after, National suggested that character receive a youthful sidekick who the readers could use as an audience surrogate. Kane initially suggested an impish character like Puck, while Finger suggested a more down-to-earth character, Robin. Finger went on to write many of the early Batman stories, including making major contributions to the character of The Joker, as well as other major Batman villains. He is also credited with the invention of the Batmobile, the Batcave, anything Bat-named, the Bruce Wayne identity, and with providing a name for Gotham City. Among the things that made his stories particularly distinctive was a use of giant-sized props -- enlarged pennies, sewing machines, or typewriters. Kane, the more business-savvy of the Kane-Finger creative team, negotiated a contract with National, signing away any ownership that he might have in the character in exchange for, among other compensations, a mandatory byline on all Batman comics stating \Batman created by Bob Kane\, even on stories with which he had no direct involvement. Bill Finger's contract, by comparison, left him with a monetary pittance and no credit even on the stories that he wrote without Kane. Finger, like Joe Shuster, Jerry Siegel, and many other creators during and after the Golden Age of Comic Books, would resent National for \cheating\ him of the money and dignity that he felt that he was owed for his creation. By the time Finger died in 1974, he had never been officially credited once for his work. He died poor and without any official heirs to continue his fight for credit. Since then, in the comic book industry, being \Fingered\ has become slang for being denied credit for one's contributions to a story or character. Posthumously, Finger has been named to the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame and Jack Kirby Hall of Fame. He is also the namesake of the Bill Finger Award.

112,"Bob Kane",112_20151001005218_creator.jpg,"Bob Kane was born Robert Kahn but legally changed his name to the familiar \Kane\ at age 18. An eager young artist, Kane came to the burgeoning comics world in 1936 with his own book that led to various assignments in the following years. Following the success of Superman in Action Comics, editors at National Publications (now DC Comics) requested more superheroes comics. In response, Kane created a character called \Birdman\. His collaborator Bill Finger offered such suggestions as renaming the character \Batman\, giving the character a cowl instead of a simple domino mask, giving him a cape instead of wings, giving him gloves, and removing bright red sections of the original costume. Finger wrote the first Batman story, while Kane provided art. Because Kane had already submitted the proposal for a Batman character to his editors at DC Comics, Kane was the only person given official credit at the time for the creation of Batman. The character was a breakout hit, but National sought to improve sales even further. Editors suggested that the character receive a youthful sidekick who the readers could use as an audience surrogate. Kane initially suggested an impish character like Puck, while Finger suggested a more down-to-earth character, Robin. Kane, the more business-savvy of the Kane-Finger creative team, negotiated a contract with National, signing away any ownership that he might have in the character in exchange for, among other compensations, a mandatory byline on all Batman comics stating \Batman created by Bob Kane\, regardless of whether he was involved in the specific issue. Bill Finger's contract, by comparison, left him with a monetary pittance and no credit even on the stories that he wrote without Kane. Kane's major contributions to Batman were in the 1940s, with several \ghost pencilers\ assisting him (like Jerry Robinson, who co-created the \Joker\ while working under Kane's name). As his comic work tapered off later in his career, Kane parlayed his official status as sole creator of Batman into a low level of celebrity. He enjoyed a post-comic book career as a painter, showing his work in art galleries. Even some of these paintings were produced by other, uncredited artists, now ghost-painting under Kane's name. Kane died in 1998 and was interred in Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles. This entry derived in whole or in part from wikipedia.org","24 October 1915",0,
113,"Joe Shuster",1/6/113_20051025060910_creator.jpg,"Joseph Shuster was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Jewish immigrants. His father Julius was an immigrant from Rotterdam, and his mother, Ida, who had come from Kiev, were barely able to make ends meet. As a youngster, Joe Shuster worked as a newspaper boy for the Toronto Star and, as a hobby, he liked to sketch. The sights and sounds of a big city newspaper, the hustle bustle of its offices, and the fantasy world of the newspaper's color comics had a powerful impact on him. He was a cousin of one of Canada's most popular comedians, Frank Shuster. At the age of ten, Joe Shuster's family moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where, by the age of 18, he and his friend Jerome Siegel began publishing a short-lived \Science Fiction\ magazine. Shuster made the drawings and Siegel did the writing, creating a super character that a few years later evolved into a comic strip. Employed by DC-National, the pair produced a variety of comic stories, including the lead feature in the company's issue of the first Action Comics in 1938. The feature character in that issue, Superman, was an enormous success that led to what is referred to as the \Golden Age of Comic Books.\ When Superman first appeared, its hero, Clark Kent, worked for the Daily Star newspaper, named by Shuster after his old employer in Toronto. When the comic strip received international distribution, the company permanently changed the name to the Daily Planet. Joe Shuster very quickly became famous as the co-creator of one of the most well-known and commercially successful fictional characters of the 20th century. At the time, in the midst of the Great Depression, he made a very good living from producing Superman stories. However, the copyright to his and Siegel's work belonged to their employer, and when the company refused to compensate them to the degree they believed appropriate, the pair sued. In 1948, the New York State Supreme Court limited their settlement to $60,000 each, at the time a large amount for someone, but very small compared to the multi-millions in profits their employer was generating annually. After the bitter legal wrangling, Joe Shuster left the comics business and his and Siegel's byline was dropped by DC comics. In 1975, Siegel launched a publicity campaign, in which Shuster participated, protesting DC Comics' treatment of him and Shuster. In the face of a great deal of negative publicity over their handling of the affair, DC's parent company Warner Communications reinstated the byline dropped more than 30 years earlier and granted the pair a lifetime pension of $35,000 a year. Joe Shuster died in Los Angeles, California. This entry derived in whole or in part from wikipedia.org","10 July 1914",0,"Toronto, Ontario, CANADA"
116,"Walter Simonson",1/5/116_20050926050347_creator.jpg,"After studying geology at school, he transferred to the Rhode Island School of Design, graduating in 1972. His thesis project there was The Star Slammers, which was published as a black and white promotional comic book for the 1974 World Science Fiction Convention in Washington D.C. (DisCon II). Some years later, he produced another version of the story in graphic novel form for Epic Comics, the Marvel Comics imprint that was a response to creator-owned lines of the early eighties. Simonson continued the adventures of the Star Slammers in a limited series in the mid-1990s as one of the founders of Malibu Comics' short-lived Bravura label. His first professional comic book work was producing war stories for DC Comics and other publishers. He also did a number of illustrations for the Harry N. Abrams, Inc. edition of The Hobbit, including the title page drawing for Chapter 3, \A Short Rest\. The book was largely illustrated using stills from the Rankin-Bass television special adaptation, which featured character designs by his friend Lester Abrams. Gray Morrow also did illustrations for that edition, as did Charles Vess. Simonson's breakthrough illustration job was \Manhunter,\ a backup feature in DC's Detective Comics written by Archie Goodwin. He is best known for his work on Marvel Comics titles in the 1980s and 1990s such as The Mighty Thor and X-Factor (the latter being a collaboration with his wife). Thor in particular is often cited as a classic, as Simonson took nearly complete control of the series and produced epic, operatic stories that rivaled Jack Kirby's best work and displayed an in-depth knowledge of Norse mythology. He also famously transformed Thor into a frog for three issues and introduced the popular supporting character, Beta Ray Bill, a monstrous alien warrior who unexpectedly proved worthy to wield Thor's hammer, Mjolnir. From 2000 to 2002, he wrote and illustrated Orion for DC. He returned to DC in 2006 to write Hawkgirl, with Howard Chaykin pencilling. He has received recognition in the comics industry for his work. Simonson's awards include Shazam Awards for Outstanding New Talent in 1973, for Best Individual Short Story (Dramatic) in 1973 for \The Himalayan Incident\ in Detective Comics #437 (with Archie Goodwin), and the same award in 1974 for \Cathedral Perilous\ in Detective Comics #441 (again with Archie Goodwin). Simonson and Goodwin also won the Shazam Award for Best Individual Story (Dramatic) in 1974 for \Gotterdammerung\ in Detective Comics 443. All three winning stories were a part of the Manhunter saga.","September 2nd, 1946",0,

He edited Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird's books, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and even negotiated their licensing deals. Leaving Mirage, Jenkins followed Eastman to Tundra, another Eastman publishing venture. He once again took up editing duties, and also headed licensing and promotions. Tired of editing, Jenkins pitched to several companies as a writer. It was during this process that he landed a gig for DC Comics' Vertigo imprint. In 1994, he took over as writer of Hellblazer, and began what would go on to be a four year long stint. His work on this title gained him attention in the American comic industry. His Marvel Comics career began as a writer on the psychological horror title, Werewolf By Night, but he may be best known for the Eisner Award winning Inhumans limited series, for the Marvel Knights imprint, with artist Jae Lee. After that, Paul joined the regular Marvel Universe and took on The Incredible Hulk and Peter Parker:  Spider-Man to great acclaim.

174,"Gene Ha",174_20051222173418_creator.jpg,"I was born in Chicago, but raised in South Bend, Indiana. The home of Notre Dame University. My parents were well-educated Korean immigrants who hoped their three sons would get prestigious degrees and move on to prestigious jobs. Didn't happen... I was the most introverted of the three Ha brothers. Being both a geek and a first generation Korean-American made me seek out escapist fantasy, especially comic books. While my brothers were both more artistically talented than me, neither of them had the patience to sit for hours on end working on one drawing. Or maybe they just had better things to do. I was the only brother not to play high school football. I think there are a lot of parallels between my generation of Asian-American comic book artists and the generation of Jewish artists and writers who created superheroes in the 1930's. Mystery men with super powers, secret identities, and absurdly Anglo names seemed to have attracted both generations. We were all the children of immigrants struggling to fit into America, and the fantasies of 1930's Jewish geeks still held appeal to 1980's Korean geeks. All of the typical comics names from the 80's were influences on me: Byrne, Miller, Sienkiewicz, Simonson, Moore, etc. But the most important was Matt Wagner. Mage is still a magical series to me, and the stubborn Kevin Matchstick and Sean the ghost are personal archetypes to this day. My dream is to make a series that will be as powerful to you (and myself) as that book was to me. Art appealed to me, not in and of itself, but as a way of creating comic books. South Bend public schools offered few classes in realistic drawing, so I took few elective classes in art. I mostly drew in other classes and after school. I was quite good at taking notes, then caricaturing the teachers before they moved on to a new idea. My high school's newspaper, the Clay Colonial, was where I really began to understand the graphic arts. I won the Most Valuable Staffer award, an unusual honor for the staff artist. I don't know where my high school and college degrees are, but I know where that plaque is. The most important thing one must do before learning is figure out what you don't know. When it came time to go to college, I had no proper portfolio and couldn't get into any self respecting school. Which is how I ended up at the Center for Creative Studies (now the \College for Creative Studies\). In my first two years, I learned how little I knew. The last two years I tried to learn it. Art school can be incredibly useful, but the degree itself is meaningless. My art was still a mess when I graduated. I've met kids stuck on farms their whole lives who can draw better than I did then, and I've met art school grads whom I wouldn't want working on the Clay Colonial. In Minneapolis I shared a studio with two artists who held day jobs and hadn't been to art school. They were incredibly dedicated and were better artists than I was when I graduated. In my last semester at CCS, I sent out drawing samples to Marvel, and a week later to DC as an afterthought. Marvel sent an unintentionally vicious letter criticizing my perspective, anatomy, and technique, everything except my storytelling. In retrospect, they were mostly right about everything but the storytelling. Still, they were needlessly harsh. DC was interested. They sent me a sample script, liked the results, and I've had regular gigs ever since.","August 19, 1969",0,"Chicago, IL"

292,"Alex Ross",1/5/292_20051003024042_creator.jpg,"Looking back, it makes perfect sense that Alex Ross would become one of the world's most pre-eminent and well-respected comic book artists. It's a job he's been preparing for nearly all his life. Born in Portland, Oregon, and raised in Lubbock, Texas, Alex made his artistic debut at three when, according to his mother, he grabbed a piece of paper and drew the contents of a television commercial he'd seen moments before. Ross came from an artistic family: his mother was a commercial artist and his grandfather, he recalls, \built working wooden toys and loved drawing.\ When Ross discovered Spider-Man on an episode of The Electric Company, his life was changed forever. \I just fell in love with the notion that there were colorful characters like this, performing good, sometimes fantastic deeds,\ Ross says. \I guess I knew this was what I wanted to do. I wanted to bring these characters to life.\ Some cynics might confuse this attitude with escapism. For Ross, it's just the opposite. \It?s a fun environment to be in,\ he admits. \Superheroes are a mixture of every form of fiction—myth , science-fiction, mystery and magic—all in one giant pot. The best characters embody virtues we may try to find in ourselves.\ Ross is quick to credit his father Clark, a minister, with laying the moral framework that allowed him to appreciate the routinely good deeds performed by the likes of Superman and Spider-Man. \My dad has given aid—physical aid, not just financial—to a number of charities and causes. He's helped at homeless shelters. He used to run a children's shelter in Lubbock. There was a positive effect to being around him, and his actions tied into what the superhero comics were teaching me. Superheroes aren't heroes because they're strong; they're heroes because they perform acts that look beyond themselves.\ As he edged towards adulthood, Ross began reading comics and taking his draftsmanship seriously, admiring the work of comic book illustrators George Perez and Berni Wrightson in particular. \They were at opposite ends of the spectrum,\ Ross recalls. Wrightson, probably best known as the co-creator of Swamp Thing, \used a lot of delicate lines to delineate shadow and tone. There weren't a lot of comic book artists employing shadows back then. Pérez, on the other hand, had a very attractive, open style with open contour lines and very little shadow. When I was 12, I would imitate Pérez's style when I drew superheroes and Wrightson;s style when I was doing 'serious' work. I realized there was no one way to go.\ This philosophy became especially true when Ross discovered such illustrators as Andrew Loomis and the great Norman Rockwell. \I idealized people like Rockwell, who drew in that photorealistic style,\ Ross says. \When I was 16 or so, I said to myself, 'I want to see that in a comic book!'\ Even as a young man, however, Ross knew \there was no satisfaction in basing my style upon the work of someone else.\ So, while his friends were exploring the uncharted territories of adolescence, Ross devoted his time to becoming a draftsman, with the long-term goal of making people believe a man could fly. \High school can be a chaotic time,\ he says. \Through my art and through what these characters represented, I found a sense of order that I wanted to apply to my life. It's not that I wasn't interested in dating or socializing. It's just that part of me didn't want to let go of the colorful characters I'd loved for so long.\ At the age of 17, Ross went to Chicago and began studying painting at the American Academy of Art, the school where his mother had studied. \My time at the Academy was really valuable,\ he recalls. \I learned where I was as an artist and what kind of discipline I'd already learned. Here I was, drawing from a model for the first time and realizing I could represent the model. Not everyone in the class could do that. It was important to make that discovery.\ Studying at the Academy also allowed Ross to examine fine art in greater depth. \Salvador Dali wound up being a big influence, actually,\ he says. \He had a vivid imagination and a hyper-realistic quality that wasn't so far removed from comic books. I began to study the classic American illustrators like Rockwell, J. C. Leyendecker. I've been called 'The Norman Rockwell of comics' more than a hundred times. I'm not going to suggest I?m on the same level as Rockwell, but attempting that sort of realism in my work has always been part of my approach.\ It was at the Academy that Ross hit on the idea of painting his own comic books. \There wasn't any moment where I saw the light and said, 'Painted comics! That's the way!'\ he recalls. \It was a by-product of my studies. There wasn't any program that taught me to ink a comic book. There were programs that taught me to paint. I just naturally thought, 'Well, of course I'm going to apply that to comics.' There were also enough painted comics out there—not a lot, but a few—that made me think that talent could be applied.\ There was also, Ross admits, a sense of wish fulfillment involved. \Hopefully by painting the work, you gain a sense of life and believability that will draw the reader in a little more. You can use color and light and shadow and live models to give the work a certain realism. It might be easier to relate to a character if you look at it and say, 'Here's an actor portraying someone. Here's something that looks real.' I thought it would draw people in and maybe add to their enjoyment of the work. There's also a part of me that likes to speculate: 'What if they made a movie about this character?' I realize some of my favorite characters will never get the movie treatment, so it's up to me to present them in a lifelike fashion, to make the movie that would otherwise never get made.\ After three years at the American Academy, Ross graduated and took a job at an advertising agency. Meanwhile, Marvel Comics editor Kurt Busiek had seen Alex's work and suggested the two men collaborate on a story. Those plans came to fruition in 1993 with Marvels , a graphic novel that took a realistic look at Marvel superheroes by presenting them from the point of view of an ordinary man. The book landed Ross his first serious media exposure, both within the industry and outside it. Fans appreciated that Ross had an obvious affection for the characters he painted, demonstrated by his attention to detail and the fact that he took the time to make these characters look so believable. Ross followed up Marvels with Kingdom Come , a futuristic story for DC Comics about a minister who must intercede in a superhero Civil War. It was a visual feast, filled with surprise cameos, in-jokes and a main character based on Ross' father, allowing Ross to publicly acknowledge his family's influence. Having established himself creatively and financially with superhero projects, Ross turned to the real world with Uncle Sam , a 96-page story that took a hard look at the dark side of American history. Like Marvels and Kingdom Come , the individual issues of Uncle Sam were collected into a single volume—first in hardcover, then in paperback—and remain in print today. Ross' recent works have celebrated the 60th anniversaries of Superman, Batman, Captain Marvel and Wonder Woman with fully painted, tabloid-sized books, depicting each of these characters using their powers to inspire humanity as well as help them. \I do the gigs I do because I care about the material,\ he says. \In some cases, it's because I like the character. In some cases, I have a vision in my head of something I must do. It all involves artistic expression. If I can't get into the work on some artistic level, I can't do it.\ In recent years, Ross has applied his artistic skills to outside projects with comic book roots, including a limited-edition promotional poster for the 2002 Academy Awards. A number of items created especially for the Warner Bros. Studio Stores —including lithographs, collector's plates and even a canvas painting of Superman—made him the best-selling artist in the chain's history. In the fall of 2001, Ross painted a series of four interlocking covers for TV Guide (featuring characters from the WB series Smallville ) and designed and sculpted a series of busts based on characters he created for the Marvel series Earth X. \Designing the statues,\ Ross explains, \was a case where I said, 'Hey, I know I can do this, and before somebody else does it—maybe differently from the way I would like it done—I can sculpt some of the characters for which I?m well-known and make sure they look the way I want them to look.'  My comics work notwithstanding, I prefer not having to rely on the labors or plans of others. For the fans' sake as well as for my own, I want to take full responsibility for the projects that bear my name.\ Forty years ago, Spider-Man learned that with great power comes great responsibility. Looking at Alex Ross, it's obvious the lesson took. Ross' career offers another important message: follow your dream. Actually, it's not far from the sort of message you might find in one of his stories.

Giordano has been active in the comics field since 1951 and credits his major artistic influences as Stan Drake, Alex Raymond and Hal Foster. As a freelance artist, Dick began his career at the Jerry Iger Studio working on Shenna for Fiction House. In the years that followed, Giordano worked his pencil and ink magic for a variety of publishers including Charlton Comics, DC Comics, Marvel Comics, Dell, American Comics, Valiant, Treasure Chest and Junior Life. In addition to his considerable freelance contributions, Giordano has acted as Editor-In-Chief for Charlton Comics, during which he oversaw the creation of their most memorable characters including such classics as The Blue Beetle and Captain Atom. As Executive Editorial Director of DC Comics, Dick was the guiding force behind such award-winning series as Alan Moore’s WATCHMEN, Frank Miller’s DARK KNIGHT RETURNS and many, many more revolutionary concepts. His creative vision at DC Comics resulted in raising the bar for creativity throughout the entire comics industry. Dick Giordano has also been responsible for launching two successful ad-art companies, namely the legendary Continuity Associates (with partner Neal Adams) and Dik-Art, Inc., of which he continues to manage to this day. With his fellow Floridian and former pupil, Bob Layton, Dick has lent his considerable penciling skills to several co-authored projects such as BATMAN: DARK KNIGHT of the ROUND TABLE, BATMAN: HOLLYWOOD KNIGHT, and the six-issue miniseries THE L.A.W. for DC Comics which reunited Dick with his Charlton characters. In recent years, Dick Giordano, along with creative partners Bob Layton and David Michelinie, formed FUTURE ENTERTAINMENT, a multi-media company. Most recently, Dick completed the art for a graphic adaptation of the classic, Moby Dick as well as his literary contributions to a biography of his fascinating career as told by author Michael Eury. This entertaining look at this legend, who has shaped the history of the comics industry, is currently available from The Two Morrows publishing company.","July 20, 1932",0,"New York City"

703,"John McCrea",703_20061113175104_creator.jpg,"I was born in Belfast in 1966. All I ever wanted to do was draw: specifically comics. From my primary school days drawing the Bionic Emu to secondary school where I drew nothing but second rate Marvel and John Byrne rip-offs (the Bulk was a good one!) my parents despaired that I would be an out-of-work no-hoper. I persevered, and in the midst of dropping out of a degree in Art and Design in Belfast, I hawked my steadily maturing work around the UK comic conventions and the British comic editors: at 2000 AD, and British Marvel. My first real professional job was on cartoon adaptation the Centurions (many thanks go to Mike Butcher) where some of my beautiful faces were, for some reason, pasted over for publication. They also paid me a pittance. More work soon followed on Action Force (British GI Joe), BLAAAM!, and I eventually got my way into 2000 AD, drawing a few Future Shocks stories. The big break came in 1988, when Garth Ennis (then 18 years old) wrote 'Troubled Souls', and a Northern Irish artist was required. It was me or Will Simpson. I got the job, and a productive partnership was born that has lasted more than 10 years so far. With Garth I've since done For a Few Troubles More, Judge Dredd, the Demon and 'Hitman', to name a few. He also let me get my hands on his Dicks and Chopper. Garth and I have created some fantastic comic characters over the years, but the greatest must be SECTION 8, that misfit band of superheroes from Gotham: Sixpack, Dogwelder (created by Steve Dillon), Bueno Excellente, Shakes, the Defenestrator, Jean de Baton-Baton, Phlegm-gem, and Friendly Fire. I am reliably informed that the action figures of said heroes are not on the way soon. I've been fortunate to work with other talented writers including Alan Grant, Doselle Young, Mark Millar, WarrenEllis and Ron Zimmerman. Now working mainly for D.C. Comics and Marvel.

985,"Nick Cardy",985_20060912061431_creator.jpg,"Nicholas Viscardi worked in the Iger/Eisner studio doing Fight Comics, Jungle Comics, Kaanga Comics for Fiction House. For Will Eisner, Viscardi drew the Lady Luck strip in the Spirit newspaper sections. Many Lady Luck stories by Chuck Mazoujian and Viscardi were credited to Ford Davis, a fictional name. In her article in the Lady Luck volume 2 reprint book, Cat Yronwode noted that somewhere in his stories Viscardi would have a subtle NV. Nick Viscardi was the first artist to draw Senorita Rio, in Fight Comics 19. Viscardi left comics to serve in World War II as a tank driver and was awarded 2 Purple Hearts. In the 1950's, as Nick Cardy, he drew the Tarzan comic strip and later worked for DC National Comics drawing 2 short lived series, The Legends of Daniel Boone and the jungle adventure, Congo Bill and stories for varied titles including House of Mystery and Gang Busters. For Standard Comics, he drew many horror and romance comics. Following those series, Cardy enjoyed a long tenure drawing 40+ issues of Aquaman, where he designed Mera and Ocean Master. With Carmine Infantino becoming publisher of DC Comics, Cardy gained more creative freedom which was most evident on the Aquaman covers. Cardy also handled most of the artwork (drawing and/or inking) for the first 42 issues of the Teen Titans among other comics stories. As the Teen Titans grew into adulthood, Cardy designed Wonder Girl's new look. On the cover of Teen Titans 23, Wonder Girl's sandals and pigtail were replaced by beads, boots and a new hairdo. Back off, tigers!! Along with the Teen Titans, Cardy found time to draw the short lived western series, Bat Lash. Even today, the combination of great stories, beautiful women and cartoonish villains makes Bat Lash a cult favorite. Cardy wrote as well as drew Bat Lash 2. After the Teen Titans, Cardy worked on Marvel Comics' Crazy Magazine and was the primary cover artist for DC from the early to mid 1970's. Cardy drew many, many covers including Superman, Action Comics, The Brave and the Bold, Batman, Flash, Ghosts, Witching Hour, Secret Origins, Jimmy Olsen, World's Finest and the various 100 Page Giant comics. During the late 1960's, Nick helped childhood friend, Al Plastino on the Batman syndicated strip. After finally leaving comics, Cardy moved on to illustrating advertising art and movie posters. Cardy worked on posters for \Apocalypse Now\, \Movie, Movie\, \California Suite\, \The Street Fighter\, \The Night They Robbed Big Bertha's\, and \Casey's Shadow\. Throughout his comics career, Cardy always handled the penciling and inking of the artwork. This is unique, occasionally during the 1950's and even more in the 1960's, artwork was usually divided between an artist who started the art in pencil and another artist who completed the art in ink. Although his drawing style changed over the years, Cardy consistently delivered artwork featuring great composition, rendering and story telling. Cardy's renditions of gorgeous female characters became one aspect of his still singular drawing style. Cardy was skilled at drawing western, jungle, crime and super-hero adventures as drawing romance, science fiction, humor and horror. Had Cardy been drawing Superman or Batman on a regular basis, he would be widely considered one of the greatest comic artists. In any case, Congo Bill, Aquaman and Teen Titans are some of the most sought after comics series. Although Nick Cardy was not as well known as some of his contemporaries, his artwork is respected and admired by those contemporaries. Cardy's cult following includes many of today's comic writers and artists. Find those Cardy comics and join the club!","October 20th, 1920",0,
