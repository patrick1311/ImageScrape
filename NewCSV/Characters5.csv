5872,Mahkizmo,,5872_20080115080056_char.jpg,"Mahkizmo was immensely durable and strong, comparable to the Thing.  He could release explosive force from his body sufficient to level a small building; he could add this energy to his punches or release it as an omnidirectional wave.",,"Mahkizmo is the superhumanly strong ruler of Machus, a warlike alternate future Earth in which women are enslaved by men. Like Thundra, he came from the 23rd century; although in Thundra's future, women enslaved the men, in Mahkizmo's timeline the men subjugated the women. Thundra had gone to the 20th century of Earth-616 to prevent the existence of Machus by altering the past, and Machus was sent to stop her. He fought and defeated the Fantastic Four and teleported Thundra back to Machus. There, he used an energy beam to imprison her and sap her will. The Fantastic Four followed them using Doctor Doom's time machine, but Mahkizmo and the men of Machus defeated the heroes and claimed Medusa (who was a member of the Fantastic Four at the time) as his prize. Medusa entranced Mahkizmo, and knocked him out by hitting in the head with a jug of wine to escape. Mahkizmo sentenced Thundra and the Fantastic Four to death in the gladiatorial arena, fighting them himself when they defeated his champions. As Mahkizmo defeated them all, Medusa arrived with Thundra's Femizons, who fought the Machans. Mahkizmo summoned the energy for his devastating nuclear-punch, but Thundra and the Thing punched him at the same time and caused an energy implosion, destroying Mahkizmo. This caused the last barriers between the two Earths of Machus and Femizonia to dissolve and the two worlds merged. |||| |||| Mahkizmo survived the implosion as an intangible, invisible cloud of atoms. He was furious that the men and women of the now-joined world were able to live in harmony. He took over one of the new world's men and transformed it into his own. He traveled back to the 20th century and planned to kill all of the women in the past to prevent the worlds from merging. He attacked the She-Hulk, until Cupid shot him with an arrow that caused him to fall in love with the She-Hulk. He took her back to his world to make her his bride, but the Thing and Wyatt Wingfoot followed them. The She-Hulk and the Thing combined their power and defeated Mahkizmo. |||| |||| Mahkizmo was one of the Fantastic Four's enemies that attended a gathering by the Puppet Master in an effort to combine forces. The Fantastic Four captured Mahkizmo and transferred him to the newly constructed Vault in the Negative Zone. Mahkizmo and the rest of the inmates were released from their cells by the Negative Zone sorceress Threska; however, the inmates fought the Fantastic Four, and were returned to their cells."

Her stings can now be projected without these mechanical aids.",,"Janet van Dyne was a daughter of a wealthy scientist named Vernon van Dyne. During an experiment, however, an alien monster was unleashed and Dr. van Dyne was killed. Her father's associate, Dr. Henry 'Hank' Pym, had created a substance called 'Pym particles', which allowed the user to grow or shrink in size, and had become the superhero Ant-Man; when Janet's father died, she convinced Pym to help her, and he gave her a supply of 'Pym particles' and subjected her to a procedure which granted her the ability to, upon shrinking, grow wings and fire blasts of energy, which she called her 'wasp's stings'. As Ant-Man and The Wasp, they defeated the monster and sent it to its own dimension, and had several more adventures together. |||| |||| Soon afterward, the superhero team, which Janet herself dubbed the Avengers, formed, and the pair were among its founding members. Although they took occasional leaves of absence, the two have almost always remained members; during the course, Janet grew as a person and several years later would be elected leader of the team. |||| |||| The relationship between Janet and Pym had always been one of loving squabbling, but her wealth and his research had always stopped him from proposing. One day a cocky new costumed crime fighter called Yellowjacket broke into Avengers HQ. He claimed to have disposed of Pym and even kidnapped Janet. To the outrage of her colleagues, Janet then married Yellowjacket. A tension-filled wedding was made even more edgy by an attack by the Circus of Crime. During the fight it was discovered that Yellowjacket was Pym. He had had an accident with some chemicals causing him a severe case of Schizophrenia. Janet had realized this from very early on and had taken advantage to finally tie the knot. |||| |||| However, her relationship with Pym became rocky, as he suffered a further series of mental problems. A few years later, Pym had a complete breakdown, and became completely paranoid. During the course of this breakdown, he became overbearing and verbally abusive. At the nadir of his degeneration, he struck Janet, and then proceeded to concoct a plan to make himself look good in front of his teammates by staging an attack upon them which only he could stop. This plan backfired and Pym was exposed, disgraced, and expelled from the Avengers, and the couple divorced. She remained with the team despite these hardships, and after Pym's mental state returned to normal, the two became friends again and, some years later, resumed a romantic relationship. |||| |||| During the Disassembling of the Avengers by Scarlet Witch, she was knocked into a coma by an attack on Avengers Mansion. Hank watched over her as she lay in the hospital, and when she recovered, they reconciled. The two have retired from the Avengers in order to pursue a new life together in Oxford. |||| |||| During the recent Civil War that pitted super-hero against super-hero in regards to the Superhuman Registration Act that was passed into law, The Wasp sided with the pro-registration hero's led by Iron Man against Captain America's anti-registration side. |||| |||| After the war that swept across the United States and ended in a completely destructive battle in New York, the pro-registration side emerged victorious after Captain America, seeing the destruction being caused by the conflict, surrendered himself to the authorities. |||| |||| Since the resolution of the conflict, The Wasp has once again joined up with The Avengers in the form of a new Avengers team forming after the end of Civil War, The Mighty Avengers."

1813,Kang (Marvel),Nathaniel Richards (Kang) ,1813_20060329073117_char.jpg,"Kang ages at a slightly slower rate than modern humanity. |||| |||| Kang typically carries various weapons, such as an anti-matter defense screen generator, a 'vibration-ray' projector, an electromagnetic field-amplifier, neutrino-ray warheaded missile launcher (hand-gun size), electrical paralysis generator, nerve gas sprayer, and a molecular expander. Kang commands a vast armada of warriors from across the galaxy of his future era. He uses numerous robots, most notably his Growing-Man stimuloids, packed with the 'Growth Pollen' of the world Kosmos, which causes them to grow in size and strength by absorbing kinetic energy. |||| |||| Kang's primary base in 40th-century Other Earth is the Center, but he also maintains a secret dwelling in the realm known only as Purgatory, as well as strongholds in various alternate realties. His former base Chronopolis, powered by the Heart of Forever, served as a crossroads into virtually every era in human history, but lay just out of phase with the timestream and was therefore undetectable. Its palace and inhabitants were unaffected by temporal divergence or the passage of time. Kang formerly employed a 20' long space-worthy vehicle housing his time machine, which could reach all eras of all timelines by accessing the transtemporal realm of Limbo. Kang has used a number of other vessels, such as his Sphinx ship and Damocles Base, an immense sword-shaped orbiting headquarters.",,"Nathaniel Richards was born in the calendar year 3000 of the alternate timeline Other Earth (a.k.a. Earth-6311). Bullied as a youth, his throat was slit by a bully, Morgan, and he was hospitalized for a year. Recovering, he studied science and his ancestor's history tapes of the heroic age of Earth-616 (mainstream Earth), growing into a man of adventure in a time of complacency. At age 25 he discovered his ancestor's fortress and time machine. Following encounters with alternate Earth Fantastic Fours seeking to thwart his future self, which faded from his mind, Richards constructed an immense sphinx-shaped ship and traveled to Egypt circa 2950 BC. The ship crashed, blinding and stranding him there, but he subjugated the natives with his technology. He forced the natives to procure for him a radioactive herb which would restore his sight, then, as Pharaoh Rama-Tut, he ruled as a god for a decade, during which he encountered Samira, Mistress of the Nile, who became his enemy; Amenhotep, whom he transformed into a vampiric creature; and time-travelers such as Killpower and the Genetix team. At some point he had a son, Ramades, by a slave. Eventually, a struggle with the Fantastic Four, which also involved the young En Sabah Nur (later Apocalypse), the moon god Khonshu, and modern-era heroes Dr. Strange and the Avengers, forced Rama to flee that time period. |||| |||| En route to the future, a 'time storm' diverted Rama to the modern era and an encounter with a space-lost Dr. Doom. Damaged by the time storm, Rama-Tut's control module skipped several years into the future and briefly crashed in Egypt, where he fought fellow time-travelers Blaquesmith and Cable. Inspired by Doom, he took the armored identity of the Scarlet Centurion, traveled to another timeline (Earth-689) and duped its Avengers into neutralizing all their fellow heroes so he could rule; but he was defeated by the visiting Avengers of Earth-616 and cast outside time. |||| |||| Richards sought to return to his native time, but temporal disruptions hurled him into Other Earth's 40th century. As Kang, he conquered that entire world, sparing only the tiny kingdom of Carelius due to his interest in the king's daughter, Ravonna. Kang's life became progressively non-linear, as each foray in time produced at least one divergent-timestream counterpart; it is extremely difficult to identify which Kang counterpart was involved with each encounter. Conquering everything within 100 light years, Kang next attacked his ancestor's world in the modern age of marvels, but the Avengers forced him to flee. Seeking a new power base, Kang established himself in 1901 AD as Victor Timely, a brilliant inventor and industrialist who founded the city of Timely, Wisconsin, became its first mayor, and transformed it into a technological marvel over the next century; 'Victor' appeared to age and be replaced by his children (Kang in new guises). The city also housed a portal to his base Chronopolis where he gathered warriors from various eras to serve as his strike force, the Anachronauts. Kang's continued efforts saw his Spider-Man robot (Timespinner) destroyed by the Avengers and Spider-Man, and his conquest of Camelot foiled by the time-traveling Thing and Human Torch. He also assaulted the Reed and Sue Richards wedding, unknowingly drawn there by Dr. Doom's Emotion-Charger device. |||| |||| Returning to the 40th century, Kang completed his galactic conquest and even invaded other dimensions. In Kosmos, he gained technology to create his powerful Growing Men. Kang then brought the Avengers forward in time, intending to subjugate them or defeat them in front of Ravonna. When both the Avengers and Ravonna defied him, the furious Kang easily conquered her small kingdom; however, when he tried to force Ravonna to marry him, he caused unrest in his troops for failing to follow his own edict of slaying all conquered rulers. Kang's troops, led by General Baltag, turned on him, but he allied with the Avengers to defeat them. Impressed that Kang had risked his life for her, Ravonna leapt in the path of a blast from the defeated Baltag, saving Kang, but apparently dying in his place. The devastated Kang sought to restore Ravonna. Later, the cosmic Grandmaster challenged him to a contest of champions, offering him the power of life or death as the prize. Using the Avengers as pawns, Kang was victorious, but he chose the power of death, intending to slay the Avengers. Foiled by the Black Knight, Kang had to live with the knowledge that he had squandered his chance to save Ravonna. Disturbed at having lost and feeling sympathy for Ravonna, the Grandmaster removed Ravonna from stasis, revived her, and told her of Kang's betrayal. Moving on, Kang tried to use the Hulk to destroy Bruce Banner's ancestor to prevent the Avengers from ever forming, but the Hulk foiled this plot. Kang then sent a robot double of himself to capture the Avengers during a war with rival time lord Zarrko the Tomorrow Man. |||| |||| One of Kang's most relentless campaigns was his quest for the Celestial Madonna, a woman fated to give birth to the most powerful being in the universe. Wanting to be that being's father, Kang narrowed the Madonna's identity to Agatha Harkness, Mantis, and the Scarlet Witch, abducting all three. Rama-Tut, actually Kang's own future self, arrived to help the Avengers thwart his plot. Mantis was finally revealed as the Madonna, and when Kang could not claim her, he tried to kill her; but his fatal blast was intercepted by the Swordsman, who died instead. Kang and Rama-Tut were then pulled into Limbo by Immortus, a potential future self of both men, but Kang imprisoned Immortus and used his technology to create the Legion of the Unliving, a team of reportedly deceased pawns drawn from past eras. The Avengers defeated the Legion and Kang fled. Kang soon returned, allied with a trio of Kangs from different time periods, and tried to abduct Mantis at her wedding, but Immortus foiled him by substituting a Space Phantom as his captive. |||| |||| Kang next made a base in Tombstone, Arizona, circa 1873 AD, intending to use it as a stepping stone to conquer the modern age. Opposed by cowboy heroes, as well as time-traveling Avengers, Kang disintegrated when his force field shorted out in battle with Thor. However, a failsafe device transported Kang's consciousness to an alternate body, as it had during many other near-death experiences. Though taking place in rapid succession in the modern era, these last two campaigns accounted for ten years of Kang's life. Less time-intensive efforts included seeking the reality-altering power of a Cosmic Cube, facilitating an attempt by the Inuit (Eskimo) Aningan Kenojuak to reclaim Captain America as the 'God in the Ice' worshipped by his people years ago, conquering an alternate 40th-century Earth, battling the legendary First Line, and participating in the hero vs. villain war on the virtually omnipotent Beyonder's Battleworld. |||| |||| Kang then found his 40th-century base ravaged by rebels loyal to Baltag. To recover his base, he sought out a Growing Man stored in the modern era and battled Thor, who banished him to Limbo. There Kang chanced across Immortus' stronghold, Tenebrae, and learned of his own multitude of divergent counterparts. Unwittingly manipulated by Immortus, Kang formed the Council of Kangs, choosing a few of his most capable counterparts as allies, and began eliminating redundant Kangs from each alternate reality. One of these sought to pair with an alternate Ravonna and wipe out all other realities, but was eliminated after accidentally killing his lover. Kang prepared robot duplicates to replace the slain counterparts to rule the empires of every Kang in existence. At the same time, Kang re-took his 40th-century base via his Growing Man. After the rest of the counterparts were eliminated, the prime Kang slew the rest of the Council. |||| |||| Immortus then appeared, explained that he was Kang's future self, and showed Kang a psyche-globe containing the memories of all of the slain divergent Kangs. Kang tore the globe from his hands, only to go mad as the minds of all of the other Kangs merged with his. The last Kang-now every Kang, since he possessed all of his counterparts' memories-fled into Limbo. To save himself, Kang used his helmet's temporal circuitry to create an additional divergence/counterpart, dividing his madness between two Kangs. One made his way to Chronopolis to recuperate, while the other, still addled, was recruited by the Cross-Time Kangs, a group of beings who had defeated or slain alternate Kangs and usurped the Kang identity. That Kang learned of a plot by Kang-Nebula (actually a power-hungry Ravonna) to obtain the 'ultimate weapon' within the Time Bubble, a period of time in Earth-8810 surrounded by an impassable temporal barrier. A trio of Kangs followed Kang-Nebula into the Time Bubble where they were cast into the vortex surrounding it and ultimately destroyed, though the divergent Kang also sent his Growing Man to help foil the demonic Inferno invasion of Earth. |||| |||| Taking control of Chronopolis, the prime Kang sought revenge on Mantis in the modern era, joined Dr. Doom during the Infinity War, took over the Cross-Time Kangs, learned an assassin was stalking him, and exposed his would-be killer as Ravonna, now calling herself the Terminatrix. Intrigued by her warrior nature, Kang battled her, but sacrificed himself to save her from an assault by the Avengers. Overcoming her hatred for Kang, Ravonna impersonated him and took over the Cross-Time Kangs. When Chronopolis was attacked by the immensely powerful temporal entity Alioth, Ravonna revived Kang, and with the aid of the Avengers they sacrificed the Cross-Time Kangs, using their energy to imprison Alioth. |||| |||| The reunited Kang and Ravonna (who posed as Victor Timely's fiancée Rebecca Tourmenet for a time) soon ruled Chronopolis side by side. However, Kang, now almost sixty, grew weary of administrative matters. Missing the days when he was worshipped in a small land, Kang returned to ancient Egypt circa 2930 BC as Rama-Tut and smashed his chrono-sphere. As Rama-Tut, he spent ten years benevolently enjoying his people's adulation. In 2920 BC he encountered the Avengers, who had been trapped in the past by a time machine that could only travel backwards in time. Determined not to become Immortus (whose subtle manipulations he despised), the later Rama-Tut tried to break the cycle by placing himself in suspended animation, reviving in the modern era to battle his past Kang self during the Celestial Madonna struggle. Failing to change the course of events and feeling resigned to his fate, Rama headed for Limbo, but upon glimpsing a chrono-flash of Immortus bowing to the powerful Time-Keepers, he was infuriated by the idea of becoming anyone's lap-dog, and vowed to overcome his destiny. Rama-Tut returned to Chronopolis, resumed his Kang identity and used his rivals to destroy each other. He then destroyed the mind-transfer failsafe device he had so often used to cheat death, feeling that it took the risk-and thus the enjoyment-out of conflict. After a brief battle with the X-Men and an enterprising starship crew, Kang formed an alliance with Libra (Gustav Brandt), the Kree Supreme Intelligence and the Avengers against Immortus and the Time-Keepers. Ravonna and the Anachronauts were apparently slain and Chronopolis was destroyed, but Kang managed to destroy the Time-Keepers and forcibly diverge himself from Immortus, leaving his future uncharted. |||| |||| Renewed by this victory, Kang engineered a series of successors, each of whom he named Marcus. These infants were sent back in time and trained to be warriors worthy of inheriting Kang's empire. Following a failed effort to conquer the realm Otherworld, Kang, alongside Marcus XXIII (outfitted as the Scarlet Centurion), used Damocles Base, his massive armada, and alliances with various criminal forces (including rogue Atlanteans and Deviants) to conquer Earth; but the Avengers led a rebellion that ultimately defeated and imprisoned Kang. Marcus freed Kang in hopes of restoring their dominion, but Kang knew that Marcus had held back during the war more than once because of his attraction to Avengers member Warbird. Unable to forgive this betrayal, Kang slew Marcus. Disheartened, Kang told his computer to postpone development of Marcus XXIV. Regaining his focus, Kang plotted against Iron Lad, his younger self created by his meddling in his own past, and his allies in the Young Avengers. |||| Note: Differences between the history of Other-Earth and Earth-616, as well as differing calendars in different realms, and damage to records during periods of massive warfare, have led to some inconsistency in the dating of the time periods of both Kang and Ravonna."

As Marc Spector he wielded various firearms, and would occasionally employ them in his Moon Knight identity as well.",,"Marc Spector was the son of a rabbi whose family had fled Europe in the 1930s to escape the Holocaust. As Marc matured, he rejected his father's morality and embraced materialism. He became a heavyweight boxer, then a U.S. Marine, and then a CIA operative. At the CIA, Marc worked with William Cross, who betrayed the agency, later becoming the villain Crossfire. Marc's brother Randall joined him in the CIA but he also betrayed the agency, selling weapons to both sides in an altercation in Italy. When Marc's lover Lisa overheard Randall's plans, he killed her with a meat cleaver. Marc hunted Randall down, inflicting injuries that left Randall psychotic. Marc befriended fellow CIA agent Amos Lardner, but unknowingly turned him over to Operation: Cobra, a CIA project designed to control its agents' minds. Fed up with the CIA, Marc became a mercenary and spent several years as a hired gun. Although he ostensibly sought to fight for causes he believed in, Marc was easily persuaded to fight for anyone who paid him enough. While working in Africa, Marc met the French mercenary Jean-Paul DuChamp, whom he nicknamed 'Frenchie'. Marc and Frenchie became close friends, and served together on several missions. |||| |||| |||| On one assignment, Marc helped overthrow the government of Bosqueverde, a South American country, and assassinated its president, Ricardo Dominguez. Rodrigo Raposa took over the country, having promised Marc he would install a new democracy, but he actually established a fierce dictatorship. Marc and Frenchie eventually fell in with Raoul Bushman, a bloodthirsty terrorist. Bothered by Bushman's savagery and by his own stirrings of conscience, Marc began to question his mercenary lifestyle. During a mission to the Sudan, Marc saw Bushman assault the town of Selima, seeking information on archaeologist Dr. Peter Alraune's discovery of an Egyptian pharaoh's tomb which might contain gold. Dr. Alraune attempted to stab Bushman from behind, but Marc warned him in time, and Bushman slew Dr. Alraune by biting him in the neck with his steel teeth. |||| |||| Disgusted, Marc helped Dr. Alraune's daughter Marlene escape Selima, but Bushman caught Spector in the act. After Bushman executed the people of the town, Spector attacked him, only to be defeated by Bushman, who deposited the unconscious Spector in the desert and left him to die. Spector dragged himself through the sands to the tomb unearthed by Dr. Alraune and was found by Marlene and her servants. They brought him into the tomb, placing his body at the foot of a statue of the moon god, Khonshu. Marc was pronounced dead, but as Marlene wept over his body, he suddenly arose, alive. Spector believed that Khonshu had restored him to life to serve as the moon's knight of vengeance. Donning a cloak taken from Khonshu's statue, Spector destroyed Bushman's forces in Selima, but Bushman escaped when Marc was distracted by Marlene, who had followed him back to the town. Frenchie arrived to help them, and Spector collapsed into Marlene's arms, exhausted. |||| |||| Aided by Marlene and Frenchie, Spector honed his abilities to wage war on crime. Using his mercenary profits, Marc created the identity of New York millionaire Steven Grant to help him mingle with influential people. He also created the identity of Manhattan cab driver Jake Lockley to make contacts with people on the streets. As Lockley, he befriended the homeless Bertrand Crawley, his main street contact, and Gena Landers, a coffee shop owner whose sons Ricky and Ray helped perform investigative work for him. Marc eventually shared his secrets with Crawley and the Landers family. Marlene, now Marc's lover, came to regard him as Steven Grant, and he suppressed his life as Spector. Although his multiple identities threatened Marc's sanity, Marlene helped ground his psyche. She also designed the Moon Knight costume for him, while Frenchie designed the first Mooncopter, serving as Moon Knight's pilot. Marc brought the statue of Khonshu back to New York, still believing in the moon god's power. |||| |||| While Moon Knight was still establishing his reputation, Frenchie infiltrated the criminal financiers known as the Committee and learned of their plans to capture the Werewolf Jack Russell. Frenchie offered Moon Knight's services to the Committee, claiming that Moon Knight was his employee. The Committee approved, and Moon Knight fought the Werewolf, defeating him when the sun rose and he became Jack Russell again. Moon Knight brought Russell, his lover Topaz, and his sister Lissa to the Committee, who revealed that they intended to use the Werewolf to kill their enemies, and hoped that Lissa would become a werewolf as well. A disgusted Moon Knight set the Werewolf free, rescued Topaz and Lissa, and helped the Werewolf defeat the Committee. Moon Knight moved on to other cases, thwarting the political manipulator Conquer-Lord, who used elaborate death traps in a plot to assassinate the mayor of New York City for the criminal Corporation; aiding the Defenders against the android Zodiac; battling the Masked Marauder's Maggia alongside Spider-Man; defeating the hirsute terrorist Lupinar; and aiding the Thing against Crossfire. |||| |||| Moon Knight faced his brother again when Randall went on a killing spree in New York, slaughtering nurses with a hatchet. Marlene bravely posed as a nurse to draw him out for Marc, and Randall nearly killed her. Moon Knight stalked Randall, who was seemingly impaled upon a broken tree, but Randall had actually left an imposter to take his place. Marc eventually learned that his friend Amos Lardner had died trying to escape from the CIA's Operation: Cobra. While investigating, Spector was attacked by Amos's brother James, whom the project had brainwashed into becoming 'Cobra'. Moon Knight was able to short-circuit the technology controlling Lardner, who then turned on his controllers, killing them along with himself. |||| |||| Moon Knight faced other menaces such as the Slasher, a man slaying homeless people in an effort to find his father (who turned out to be Crawley); the Midnight Man, an art thief; Morpheus, a man able to control people through their dreams; Stained Glass Scarlet, a nun who became a vigilante after being forced to kill her criminal son; Daredevil's enemy the Jester; Arsenal (Nimrod Strange) and his Third World Slayers; and the satanic cult the Left Hand Path and its leader, Morning Star, whose goals led to another encounter with the Werewolf. Bushman returned to torment Spector by capturing the statue of Khonshu and destroying it. With the statue gone, Spector went insane, believing he needed Khonshu's guidance. When Marlene told him she had hidden the original statue and that Bushman had only destroyed a copy, Spector regained his sanity and defeated Bushman. It was only afterward that he thought to ask Marlene if she had told him the truth, but she observed that either way, it didn't matter. |||| |||| Moon Knight suffered another internal crisis when he faced Carson Knowles, a candidate for mayor who used the identity of Black Spectre to forcibly coerce people of influence in New York to support his campaign. Knowles had been inspired by Moon Knight to don his costume, noting how Moon Knight was feared by others because of his mask. In his first encounter with the Black Spectre, Moon Knight unmasked him, but was subsequently unable to prove that Knowles was the Black Spectre. As even Marlene began to doubt him, Moon Knight's sanity began to fray, until he turned again to the statue for guidance; he was able to draw the Black Spectre into another fight and unmask him on television, vindicating himself. |||| |||| After his father's death, Spector was outraged when his body was stolen by Reuben Davis, a former student of Elias Spector who had mastered Kaballah. Using the body as a power source, Davis took the name Zohar and used his magical power to punish Marc Spector for his sins. Moon Knight defeated Zohar, but Spector subsequently suffered another serious mental breakdown and decided to abandon all of his alternate identities to settle down with Marlene; however, he was contacted by three ancient Egyptian Priests who had served Khonshu for thousands of years, and they convinced him that he was truly the avatar of Khonshu. The priests guided Moon Knight into new adventures, his strength becoming superhuman during the full moon. Marlene, no longer willing to accept Marc as Moon Knight, left him. When members of the West Coast Avengers were stranded in ancient Egypt via time-travel, their leader Hawkeye formed an alliance with Khonshu, who contacted Moon Knight in the present to assist them. Moon Knight teamed with Henry Pym and Espirita to rescue the Avengers, and the assembled heroes defeated the alien entity Dominus, who had stranded the Avengers in the first place. |||| |||| Moon Knight stayed with the Avengers for awhile, and was gradually accepted into their ranks; but Khonshu was responsible for influencing Spector to join the team, as Spector had no interest in being an Avenger. Marc became romantically involved with Tigra, much to the disgust of Khonshu, who viewed her as a creature of the day. After Hawkeye's wife, Mockingbird, tried and failed to conceal her role in the death of the Phantom Rider (who had raped her), the couple broke up their marriage, and Moon Knight joined Tigra and Mockingbird in leaving the Avengers since all three of them believed the team's rules against killing were wrong. The three ex-Avengers formed a group of their own for a time, and helped Giant-Man (Bill Foster) escape the High Evolutionary. When the Phantom Rider's vengeful ghost haunted Mockingbird, the trio turned to Hellstorm, who revealed that Khonshu's spirit had inhabited Moon Knight's body, and drove him out to help defeat the Phantom Rider. Khonshu left the earthly plane to battle rival god Seth thereafter, leaving Moon Knight without a reason to return to the Avengers. |||| |||| Returning to New York, Spector reconciled with Marlene and embarked on new adventures, encountering the thief Midnight, son of the Midnight Man. Midnight tried to become Moon Knight's partner, but Moon Knight never took him seriously. Spector's past came back to haunt him when he was captured by the mercenary Silver Sable and brought back to Bosqueverde, now a democracy. Spector was to be tried for Dominguez's murder, but he convinced the new president, Silva, to release him in exchange for hunting down Rodrigo Raposa. Moon Knight succeeded in bringing Raposa to justice, finally exorcising a demon from his past. Returning from Bosqueverde, Spector learned that Midnight had impersonated him in his absence and run afoul of the Secret Empire, who seemingly slew Midnight and transformed him into their cybernetic agent. Moon Knight joined Spider-Man, the Punisher, Darkhawk, Nova, and Night Thrasher in opposing the Secret Empire, and Midnight apparently died when the Empire's base was destroyed. |||| |||| Learning that Randall was still alive, Moon Knight joined the Punisher in hunting him. Randall, now called Shadowknight, fought his brother in an effort to claim the mantle of the Moon Knight. Marc finally slew Randall by knocking him off of a building. During this encounter, Marc learned that Khonshu was a god of justice, not only vengeance. He reinvented his Moon Knight identity, creating a new corporate image for himself through the company Spectorcorp. He moved his base to a high-tech office tower called 'Shadowkeep', where he would meet with holographic representations of various special agents in what he called the 'Shadow Cabinet'. He also donned protective adamantium armor, and upgraded his weaponry. |||| Moon Knight became involved in the doppelgangers used by the power-mad Magus during the Infinity War. Moon Knight's double, Moonshade, allied himself with the doppelganger of the powerful young Franklin Richards, unleashing a host of dimensional counterparts against Moon Knight in a failed effort to usurp his identity. Moon Knight's new mode of operations began to worry his super-hero peers. After he abused his Avengers privileges to gain access to the Latverian embassy for a confrontation with Dr. Doom, the Avengers brought him up on charges. Unwilling to take the time to sit through these proceedings, Moon Knight destroyed his membership card and cut his Avengers ties. Moon Knight later became involved in a struggle against the Hellbent, a sub-species of humanity interbred with demons. Seth Phalkon, leader of the Hellbent, claimed to be Moon Knight's great-great grandfather, and tried to unleash a computer virus called 'Zero Hour' that would destroy every facility in Spector's network. To prevent the virus from taking thousands of lives, Spector sealed it within his headquarters. As a result, the Shadowkeep was destroyed, killing Spector. |||| |||| But as before, death could not claim Marc Spector for long. Apparently again awakened by Khonshu, Spector was reunited with Marlene and Frenchie, and set out to oppose Morpheus, Bushman and Black Spectre, who had all become affiliated with the Egyptian god Seth, enemy of Khonshu. Black Spectre and the others tried to destroy the United Nations, but Khonshu guided Moon Knight against them, thwarting Seth's plan. Subsequently, Moon Knight learned Daredevil was assembling a team of heroes to capture the Punisher. Eager to help, he offered to finance a headquarters for the unnamed team ('Marvel Knights'). He joined the group against Cloak (controlled by Nightmare) and a teaming of Bengal, Tombstone, Big Ben and Bullet. Finally, the team's base was invaded by Shang-Chi's enemy Zaran, who struck down Moon Knight with several of his miniature sais. Moon Knight's teammates brought him to safety while their base was blown up by agents of Fu Manchu. Seriously wounded by Zaran, and having lost significant money in the base's destruction, Spector was forced into retirement. |||| |||| However, Moon Knight has since recovered from his wounds and resumed his activities. He was among many former Avengers who briefly rejoined the team to fight the effects of the Scarlet Witch's out-of-control hex power. |||| Moon Knight recently battled his long time rival Bushman in a brutal encounter, carving his arch enemy's face from his body. Broken knees however have kept the moon's Knight of Vengeance confined to a wheelchair. Recovering from the war with Bushman, Moon Knight is now stalked by Taskmaster, who has been hired by the Committee to take him out."

It can shake off Spider-Man's webbing.",,"Herman Schultz is a career criminal who, after several prison terms for robbery, built a battle suit that sent out shock waves to quickly open safes as well as give him a significant advantage over the New York police. During his first outing as the self-styled 'Shocker' he ran into and defeated Spider-Man (Peter Parker), who became Schultz's nemesis. |||| |||| Schultz was usually involved in theft or extortion; a typical day in the life of the Shocker would find him knocking over armored cars or trying to hawk items he previously stole. On one particularly ambitious day, the Shocker held New York City for ransom when he blacked out portions of the city to spell out his criminal moniker, then threatened to black out the entire city unless he was paid 1 million dollars.

250,Alexander Joseph 'Lex' Luthor (DC)(Post Crisis),,250_20060309224513_char.jpg,,,"The modern version of Lex Luthor is still brilliant, but his business acumen and political savvy is emphasized to a much greater degree than it ever was.  If it can be said that John Byrne's revamp of Superman in 1986 has largely been recanted by 2005, his new spin on Luthor has been celebrated and emphasized by subsequent writers.  The 'new' Lex Luthor is a multi-layered threat to the Man of Steel, and, indeed, the whole of the DCU.  It is probably no exaggeration to say that Lex Luthor--having now been head of the DCU's single most powerful corporation, leader of several crime syndicates, and President of the United States--has appeared in or influenced events in just about every super hero title that DC has put out since 1986. |||| |||| This version of the character is quite unlike the previous version in that (arguably until 2004) very few ordinary people in the DCU had any notion that he was evil.

It was intended to be used by S.H.I.E.L.D. against the monster Godzilla. Before it could be utilized for this purpose, the robot was stolen by Takiguchi's twelve year old grandson Rob. Originally referred to as SJ3RX, the robot was named Red Ronin by the youngster. |||| |||| After an initial attempt to control the robot failed, Rob succeeded in piloting Red Ronin into battle with Godzilla, in an attempt to drive the beast off. Rob wished to prevent the radioactive creature from being harmed and his attempts to ward the monster off were designed to actually preserve his life. He succeeded in doing so and it was discovered that Ronin had been imprinted with Rob's brain patterns, making the robot useless without him to pilot it. |||| |||| Rob used Ronin a few more times, aiding Godzilla in battles against creatures such as Yetrigar, Krollar, Rhian, and Triax. During one such battle, Rhian decapitated Ronin, leaving the robot inactive. |||| |||| S.H.I.E.L.D. eventually rebuilt the robot with the aid of Stark technicians. One such technician, Earl Cowan, altered the robot so it would only respond to his brain patterns, similarly to how it had previously been linked to Rob Takaguchi. Cowan intended to use Ronin to orchestrate a series of events that would set off World War III. Fortunately, Cowan was completely ignorant of the shortest aerial route to the USSR and went eastward instead of going north and passed over New York City. This allowed the Avengers to intercept and defeat Red Ronin, and the robot's remains were carried off by S.H.I.E.L.D. |||| |||| Stane International eventually gained possession of the remains. A scientist named Karaguchi Inoyawa rebuilt the robot, hoping to use it as a force for good. The robot was displayed by Stane at a trade show at the Pontiac Silverdome. While there it was commandeered by vengeful ex-Stane employee Joe Kilman who caused it to go on a rampage. This time Inoyawa guided the Wasp in deactivating Ronin. |||| |||| Ronin eventually wound up in the hands of Fujikawa Electronics. It was altered to look even more like a samurai in appearance. Numerous military and criminal organizations such as the Hand attempted to gain possession of the mechanoid, but were foiled by Wolverine and Sunfire. |||| |||| When Red Ronin next appeared, it was used by Henry Peter Gyrich to lure the Avengers into a battle with the Thunderbolts. At some point before this time, the robot's appearance had been restored to its original form. |||| |||| Red Ronin has since 'joined' the Thunderbolts during the Civil War series. Tony Stark mentioned in the 'Civil War Files' one-shot working on that version and that the Fixer is likely all over it, though he was never seen in any battles during the event. |||| |||| Some time prior to this, it also clashed with the Inhumans and the Sentry as revealed in a flashback in New Avengers #24."

The golden bolts create dimensional gateways, the scarlet bolts and the black bolts cause deadly explosions. After Arkon's encounter with the X-Men, he gave them a quiver of golden bolts which Cyclops later used to take the X-Men to Asgard.",,"Arkon was born of noble lineage on the extradimensional world Polemachus. The people of Polemachus developed a culture that glorifies warfare, and Arkon succeeded in becoming the greatest warrior of his people. Appointed Imperion of the largest country on Polemachus, Arkon mounted military campaigns against neighboring countries in an effort to conquer the world. His dreams were forgotten when Polemachus was faced with a world-wide catastrophe in that the light-and heat-providing planetary rings were disintegrating. Arkon's scientists determined that atomic explosions occurring on Earth somehow were extradimensionally translated to rekindle the energy rings for about a year. Although Polemachus had not developed nuclear weaponry, the scientists predicted that if they were to atomically annihilate the Earth, their world's energy-rings would be restored to power. |||| |||| Toward this goal, Arkon manipulated the hero known as the Scarlet Witch into reciting a magical spell found in a Polemachian book to enable Arkon to transport himself to Earth. Attracted to the Scarlet Witch, Arkon kidnapped her as well as a group of atomic scientists. The scientists used to construct an atomic device. Before Arkon could detonate it on Earth, however, Scarlet Witch's super team, the Avengers, managed to rekindle Polemachus' energy-rings. Arkon then ceased hostilities with Earth. |||| |||| The Avengers had cause to revisit Arkon's world when their comrade, the Black Knight, was taken captive by Arkon while searching for the Well at the Center of Time. Arkon ceased hostiliites with the Avengers when he learned that he was being duped by the Asgardian Amora the Enchantress. |||| |||| Although his world now possessed the capacity for atomic power, Arkon was dissatisfied with the length of time it took to build a nuclear arsenal. Thus, he devised a plan to pit three extradimensional worlds, one of which was Earth, against one another, in hopes that the energy from the resultant nuclear conflagration could be absorbed by his world. His elaborate machinations failed, due to the efforts of the Fantastic Four. |||| |||| Arkon was forced to return to Earth yet again when the machine that Iron Man had once built to rekindle Polemachus' rings failed due to Arkon's tinkering with it. Arkon traveled to Earth to recruit Thor to recharge the machine, but he settled for the mutant X-Man known as Storm, who also had the ability to summon lightning, forcing her teammates to go after them. After a monumental struggle, the misunderstanding was settled, Storm agreed to help, and Arkon returned Storm and her allies to Earth. Another time, the X-Men and the Fantastic Four helped Arkon drive off an extradimensional invasion of Polemachus by the alien race of Badoon. |||| |||| He was later prodded via a dream-suggestion to return to Earth because a Hollywood movie had been made about him. This subliminal coaxing was from Amora the Enchantress. She had been given the task of killing Doctor Strange during the ' Acts of Vengeance ' campaign (where all the major villains teamed up and tried to see if 'swapping' foes would result in the defeat of their heroic enemies). |||| |||| Since her own attempt on Strange's life failed, she thought that Arkon's brawn might succeed where her beauty had not. She also informed him that if he should so desire, he could also slay Strange's lover & disciple; Clea. But since Amora stole his Bolts of Transport, unless he did as she demanded, he would never be able to return home. |||| |||| Although his intel from his spies incorrectly informed him that she was hideous, he knew that wedding with her would spread his kingdom to a second astral plane. With this information, and his desire to return home, he agreed to slay Strange and marry Clea. |||| |||| Once he lay eyes upon her, however, he realized that she was 'breathtakingly beautiful' (and realized that his spies, who were mutated anthropoids would have a different sense of physical beauty). Because he knew that he would most likely not be able to defeat Strange due to the mystic's mastery of sorcery, Arkon lured Strange to a power plant and inserted some of his power lightning bolts inside the plant's dynamo. Any use of magic by Strange, or any attempt to remove the bolts would cause the plant to explode, destroying the city. Arkon's plan was to kill Strange in hand-to-hand combat. |||| |||| Although Strange gave a good fight, he could not over-power Arkon who, seemingly, killed him. However, it turns out that Clea had cast a spell to give Strange the appearance of death, saving his life, and she then proceeded to attack Arkon herself. When he realized that he was in too deep, he demanded the Enchantress return his golden bolts of transport so that he may remove himself from Earth. Enchantress fled and then Clea dispatched him to his world herself. |||| |||| Some time later, Arkon traveled to Earth to employ the Avengers and Fantastic Four as pawns in his war with rival otherworldly monarch Thundra, until he made peace with Thundra after realizing they shared a strong mutual attraction. Later, with consort Thundra, Arkon sought Avengers' aid in repairing Polemachus's energy ring and protecting the maiden Astra from becoming a human sacrifice to Polemachus' religious zealots led by the high priest Anskar. |||| |||| Arkon also had a rival in his Grand Vizier, who, over time, convinced Arkon to return Polemachus to a more barbaric lifestyle rather than rely on its science. The Grand Vizier then abducted the superhero and Avenger Photon (Monica Rambeau) along with the supervillains battling her at the time, the Wrecking Crew. The Grand Vizier used the Wrecking Crew to depose of Arkon and Thundra, until the Avengers arrived to rescue their teammate and restore Arkon to the throne. Polemachus returned to its hybrid barbaric/scientific lifestyles. |||| |||| Arkon, Thundra, and all of Polemachus were last seen being wiped out by Krona during the JLA/Avengers crossover miniseries. However, since this took place in an inter-company crossover story, Arkon, Thundra, and Polemachus itself may have all been restored to normal when the miniseries ended. |||| |||| In the Marvel Universe a series of low-budget sword and sorcery movies have been made about Arkon. Simon Williams (Wonder Man), in his first major Hollywood role, played the villain in one installment."

With her favorite professor, Dr. Wilma Calvin, and maverick scientist Theodore Sallis, and others stationed in the Florida Everglades, the project was betrayed by Ellen Brandt, Sallis's lover, and Dr. Paul Allen, another scientist on the project Morse was sent to investigate by pretending she loved him. Unbeknownst to Morse, Sallis's only sample of the serum inadvertently transformed him into the Man-Thing.  Morse and Allen enlisted the aid of Ka-Zar in investigating Sallis's disappearance.  They found Brandt, insane, and got her to a hospital. Ka-Zar uncovered Allen's treachery, and Man-Thing burned him to death, after which Morse was assigned to accompany Ka-Zar to New York City to find and destroy additional copies of the sample while Dr. Calvin recovered from a gunshot wound in the hospital, and Morse and Ka-Zar helped get Calvin's son out of the illegal drug business. |||| |||| Morse subsequently used the costumed identity of the Huntress and later Mockingbird to expose the corrupt activities of certain S.H.I.E.L.D agents. After being injured in her work she received a commendation by then S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury, who used her information to expose dozens of subversives within S.H.I.E.L.D. Resigning from S.H.I.E.L.D., Mockingbird was hired to investigate Cross Technological Enterprises (CTE), where she clashed with security director Hawkeye. The two soon discovered that CTE was working for the criminal Crossfire helping to implement his plans to brainwash super heroes into killing each other off. The two joined forces against Crossfire and his underlings, becoming attracted to each other in the process. At the case’s successful conclusion, Mockingbird proposed to Hawkeye and the two married. When Hawkeye was appointed head of the West Coast branch of the Avengers, Mockingbird became the team's first new recruit and was instrumental in helping Hawkeye form the new team. |||| |||| Months later, during a time traveling adventure in 1876, Mockingbird was abducted and drugged by the crazed vigilante called the Phantom Rider (Lincoln Slade), who attempted to force her to become his bride. Regaining her senses, Mockingbird fought the Rider and allowed him to fall to his death. After the West Coast Avengers returned to their home era, Mockingbird kept the nature of the Phantom Rider’s death a secret. However, the Rider’s ghost soon appeared and told the Avengers what had transpired. Distraught that an Avenger (especially his wife) had allowed a man to die, Hawkeye became estranged from his wife, and Mockingbird re-entered into government service. She participated in Operation: Vigilance, a program to provide protection from any potential threat from the Vision, only to rebel once she discovered the program's full agenda. Helping the Avengers to rescue the Vision, she was gradually reconciled with Hawkeye. Together they helped train the Great Lakes Avengers and Mockingbird became good friends with Ashley Crawford. The pair eventually renewed their relationship, only for Mockingbird to perish while protecting Hawkeye from the demonic Mephisto. She has since been resurrected by the Grim Reaper for his Legion of the Unliving, but turned against him. Before returning to the realm in which she was paying her penance for killing the Phantom Rider, she gave a warning to the Avengers which eventually led to the resurrection of Hellcat. |||| |||| Recently Clint (as Ronin) was reunited with Bobbi in the mysterious Savage Land when she stepped out of a crashed Skrull space craft along with several other heroes including Captain America. When Mister Fantastic arrives and reveals that Mockingbird is another Skrull impersonator Clint kills the Skrull who had taken the form of his wife. Latter in the final battle of the Secret Invasion Iron Man finds a Skrull ship in orbit with many of the kidnapped heroes on board and among them is Mockingbird. It is still unclear how she can be alive when it was established that she is currently fighting battles in the afterlife, but Clint has accepted that this is truly his long lost wife returned to him."

He was raised much like any other child enjoying boyish pursuits like automobiles and girls. After school, he would often hang out at the local garage with his friends. After his mother died and his father was imprisoned for illegal medical procedures, Susan, his older sister, took care of him. When Susan pursued her infatuation, Reed Richards, to California, Johnny followed. |||| |||| In a pledge of her faith in Reed's plans, Susan volunteered herself and Johnny to accompany him and his co-pilot Ben Grimm in Reed's experimental rocket ship. After the ship crashed, Johnny found he had the ability to envelop himself in a flammable plasma without harm to his body. He also gained the ability to manipulate flames of any sort, including fireballs which he can generate. The plasma may encompass any part or all of Johnny's body and the air around him becomes so hot that Johnny can propel himself through the air. |||| |||| At first, Johnny tried to conceal his identity to the public, but he quickly learned that it was very difficult and he soon gave it up. He has since become more of a showman than the other members of the Fantastic Four, and is usually more than happy to demonstrate his powers at the drop of a hat. His tricks often include juggling fireballs, flying through flaming obstacle courses, and creating small fireworks displays. |||| |||| On a handful of occasions, Johnny has enrolled at various colleges since his high school graduation, but his fame and power-based responsibilities have always forced him to postpone finishing. During his first term at Empire State University, he met his friend Wyatt Wingfoot. Wyatt has often provided Johnny with a shoulder to lean for many of his human problems, much the same way Spider-Man has for his super-powered ones. And during his last enrollment there, he was attacked by Devos and Paibok and the resulting battle destroyed a fair portion of the campus. |||| |||| Although Johnny had well-known for his perpetual bachelor's life, he tried settling down with Alicia Masters, Ben Grimm's old girlfriend, while Ben was on the planet known as Battleworld following the Secret Wars. Alicia turned out to be a Skrull spy, sent to infiltrate the FF and help cause their (and consequently Earth's) downfall. However the Skrull, Lyja, did in fact fall in love with Johnny and tried to re-establish their relationship as Norma Green. He saw through her ruse and accepted her back into his life shortly before he was sent to the Heroes Reborn universe. Lyja quickly disappeared, and Johnny has not been able to locate her since his return."

Neither Lori nor her father suspects Mrs. Zechlin's addiction because she abuses stolen prescription pharmaceuticals supplied by local drug dealers. |||| |||| One day, overwhelmed by shame, Mrs. Zechlin commits suicide by overdosing and drowning herself in her pool. Lori discovers the body when she comes home from school. Lori also discovers, later that same night, that she has a mystical ability – she could 'borrow' the magical powers of other superheroes or supervillains. She did not have the same control over the powers as their owners and had little control over when she could take them or how long she could use them. Despite this, Lori (taking the name Black Alice) formulates a plan to avenge her mother's death and punish the prescription drug traffickers whom she saw as above the law. |||| |||| Lori's father, shattered and slipping into depression, becomes a recluse. He tries to pretend for Lori's sake that nothing was wrong. Her mother's death also distressed Lori, but she was aware of the change in her father and assigned herself the role of caregiver. Her grades began to slip, and she became alienated from her peers. Her primary social group, a Wiccan circle, expelled her because she was emitting 'black energy' after her mother's death (in actuality, the circle's leader – her best friend, Dawn – was jealous of Lori's real and growing powers). |||| |||| Having recently left Gotham City following the destruction of their clock tower headquarters, the super-hero team the Birds of Prey are traveling the country by jet in order to identify and help previously unknown metahumans. Oracle had become aware of Lori's power, but not her specific abilities.

He uses a nimbus of intermingled photons and anti-gravitons to levitate or fly at great speeds.",,"Though best known as a 31st century hero in the alternate reality Earth-691 timeline, the enigmatic, space-faring Starhawk originated a millennium earlier. His power was granted to him by the Hawk God of Arcturus. He was a vastly powerful cosmic being embodying the predatory nature of existence. The Hawk God's influence and actions were often destructive, but they fulfilled a greater universal purpose. His fellow cosmic beings felt that he was power-crazed, excessively violent and gratuitously cruel. The cosmic being known as Eternity brought charges against the Hawk God for causing the near-total extinction of the Watchers. The Hawk God was tried before the council of cosmic equals and the Living Tribunal performed the position of judge. The Hawk God was prosecuted by the last surviving Watcher, Ulig, and defended by the world devourer Galactus who sympathized with the Hawk God's predatory nature. |||| |||| The Living Tribunal declared the Hawk God dangerous, partly because he was thought to be a likely instigator of the long-prophesied reality-threatening War of the Cosmic Beings. The Hawk God was sent back to the planet Arcturus IV, around Earth's early 20th Century. He was among the gods worshiped by the early Arturians, and they constructed a 30' robotic computer in his likeness. Upon his demotion, the Hawk God was trapped in this immense replica, in an inactive state. |||| |||| The humanoid Arcturian race is presumed to be violent and unstable, this trait is thought to be a side effect of the constant daylight, due to the planet having twin suns. They measure their lifespans in centuries instead of years. The Arcturians also practice genetic engineering. This practice ended in a planet-wide nuclear war. |||| |||| Starhawk recently returned, changed to a female form and later sacrificed his life to save the current Guardians team."

He was also able to turn invisible using a cloaking device.",,"The enigmatic being called Iconoclast was sent by unknown forces to 'null' the Invisible Woman, before she could do the same to his people. Using cloaking technology, Iconoclast stalked Susan Richards, before finally attacking her while she was spending some quality time with her husband, Reed. Susan managed to knock him out of a window, but Reed couldn't see Iconoclast, or his energy blasts directed towards his wife. |||| |||| Iconoclast and the Invisible Woman fought in the snow outside, until the rest of the Four showed up. Noticing the footprints in the snow, Reed directed the Torch to burn the snow, covering Iconoclast in a thin mist, making him visible. But even though the Four could see him, they still couldn't attack him, as he'd simply turn intangible to avoid their blows. Susan eventually tricked Iconoclast into blindly striking at her until she had levitated them over a river, where she managed to drop him into the water, causing his cloaking device to short circuit and explode. |||| |||| |||| Iconoclast attended a gathering of enemies of the Fantastic Four held by the Puppet Master, who suggested that they combine their forces.

Eric Needham was a small time crook who was addicted to heroin. Desperate for money to buy more drugs, he robbed a liquor store and killed the owner, who turned out to be his father. After being arrested, he kicked the habit out of remorse and began a war on the drug trade. |||| |||| Donning a costume, he became a self-styled vigilante and began killing those suspected of dealing drugs. This soon brought him into conflict with Batman. Needham believed that the two should be allies, as he saw common purpose in their war against criminals. His murderous methods however continually put him at odds with the Dark Knight. |||| |||| Despite his professed desire to fight criminals, the Black Spider occasionally allied himself with costumed villains (most notably in the gathering of super-villains in Detective Comics #526 and Batman #400). Ostensibly, Black Spider's goal in this was to seek revenge against Batman, or at least, this is how he attempted to justify his actions in his own mind. |||| |||| During his war, Needham's wife and son were killed by a drug lord who had discovered the Black Spider's identity. In rage, the Spider prepared for one final assault. After being shot multiple times, Needham invaded the drug lord's headquarters and detonated explosives strapped to his back, killing the drug dealers in the process. |||| |||| Eric Needham later turned up in Neil Gaiman's critically acclaimed fantasy comic, The Sandman, dating supporting character, Lyta Hall. No explanation was given for his resurrection. However, earlier issues of the series depicted the souls of sinners escaping Hell when its ruler, Lucifer abdicated the throne. Presumably, Needham was among these. |||| |||| Whatever the case, Needham's survival has since been confirmed and the character has made subsequent appearances as the Black Spider, such as in the miniseries Underworld Unleashed.

It is assumed that in order to grow the stimuloid draws its additional mass from an extra-dimensional source. The Growing Man's original size is that of a child's doll, but it can achieve the height of a building ten stories tall.

The Growing Man's circuitry appears to have limits, however, as both Thor and Hercules are able to disorient and damage the android with a series of super-strong blows",,"The Growing Man was originally built by an alien race on behalf of the time-traveling villain known as Kang the Conqueror, who had subjugated their planet, Kosmos. Knowing that the android would be used as a weapon in the past, the scientists of Kosmos build a device into the android which would deliver a warning message to their ancestors to prepare for Kang's coming.

The android reactivates soon after and battles the Thunder God Thor, before being deactivated and recovered by Kang. Months later, Kang uses the Growing Man to abduct Tony Stark - the alter-ego of Iron Man - from a hospital. The Avengers attack and follow the Growing Man into the future, where they become involved in his competition against the Elder of the Universe the Grandmaster. |||| |||| The alien colonizers of Rigel eventually find the Growing Man in one of Kang's abandoned vessels and send it back to Earth to use it against Iron Man, who eventually defeats the android by overloading its circuitry.

When he first appeared, he was the first person to be given the title of US Government Liaison to the Avengers by the National Security Agency. With his status, Gyrich was one of only two humans (the second being the President of the United States) who could affect the Avengers in many difficult ways. During his tenure with the Avengers, Gyrich revoked their priority status after noting several (in his mind) problems with the team. The Avengers had to accept Gyrich's 'suggestions' or not be able to use their Quinjets and other sensitive equipment again. He limited the Avengers' active membership to seven members, forced the Falcon to join against his will to fill a quota and installed various security measures for the team. |||| |||| Gyrich oversaw the Avengers' activities for the next several months without incident, until he forbade them to go on a mission to help Quicksilver. The next incident involved a security leak. Gyrich took part in a Senate investigation involving the Avengers which claimed they were threats to national security. When the investigation was over, the Senate committee gave the Avengers new guidelines to follow; they also named Raymond Sikorski as his successor. |||| |||| Commission on Superhuman Activities |||| |||| Gyrich became a member of the Commission on Superhuman Activities, the oversight body on superhuman activities in the United States; there he was part of the team that forced Captain America to resign. Gyrich also took part in Project: Wideawake as a special consultant. This project was a covert government commission designed to deal with the problems concerning mutants in America. The project was instrumental in creating a team of mutants to counter the threat of foreign mutants. This team was called Freedom Force. |||| |||| Gyrich later became involved in the United States' war efforts against the alien Dire Wraiths. This time, he worked alongside Forge, a mutant who worked as a weapons maker for the U.S. government & S.H.I.E.L.D. Gyrich took a specially designed superhuman power-neutralizing gun of Forge's to capture the mutant Rogue because she had broken into a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility. In an encounter with Rogue, Storm, and government forces, Gyrich accidentally shot Storm. This specialized weapon stripped Storm of her powers and abilities as a mutant, although she regained them some time later. Gyrich continued attempting to use Forge's own version of the Spaceknight Rom's Neutralizer, planning to use an orbital version to wipe out all superpowers on Earth. He was stopped in the attempt by Rom and Forge, and could only watch, tied up, as Rom banished Wraithworld instead of destroying all the heroes and villains. Gyrich was also involved in hunting the Hulk after the events of Onslaught. |||| |||| Operation: Zero Tolerance |||| |||| Gyrich became a key player in Bastion's Operation: Zero Tolerance. He was a faithful believer in the operation until he himself became a target of Prime Sentinels. After being rescued by Spider-Man, Marrow, and Callisto, Gyrich demanded the operation be shut down. |||| |||| Destroy Earth's superhumans |||| |||| He was promoted to succeed Valerie Cooper as the head of the Commission on Superhuman Activities. While there, Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker secretly placed Gyrich under the control of nanites. Gyrich used Commission resources and remolded the vigilante Nomad into the assassin Scourge and attempted to live out his 'fantasy' of killing all the world's superhumans, before being stopped by the Thunderbolts. |||| Captain America giving Gyrich a second chance, in these panels from Avengers Vol. 3 #61, with artwork by Gary Frank. |||| Captain America giving Gyrich a second chance, in these panels from Avengers Vol. 3 #61, with artwork by Gary Frank. |||| |||| Return to the Avengers |||| |||| Following that incident, he was reassigned to the U.S. State Department and was made the liaison for Black Panther as well as the Avengers' new liaison (this time, by Captain America's suggestion) to the United Nations. During this time, he redeemed himself in the eyes of the team when he refused to deliver information on the Avengers to the Secretary of State, Dell Rusk (secretly the Red Skull). He never broke, even under severe duress, which impressed the others. Gyrich was a faithful liaison officer to the Avengers. During Avengers Disassembled, Gyrich's job came to an end after the United Nations ended their relationship with the Avengers"

Ability to use the timestream's energies to alter his appearance or produce force blasts. He can also peer into a person's past.,,"In the year 2030, Matthew Ryder lived in a world ruled by Monarch, who kept order on Earth through dictatorial rule and a powerful police force. No heroes existed in his world, but Ryder remembered a time when there were superheroes. He hated that his family's beliefs and actions were adversely affected by Monarch's methods; he was disillusioned to Monarch's authority. Thus, when he learned that quantum physists of his time had developed the possiblity of sending a person into the timestream, Ryder volunteered for the project. Monarch needed someone to enter the timestream to make sure it was safely navigable for himself; Ryder hoped that this opportunity would allow him to go back in time and discover Monarch's true identity and to prevent the future in which he lived."

1479,Martha Clark 'Ma' Kent (DC)(02 - post-Crisis),,1479_20070227022857_char.jpg,,,"Starting with Byrne's Man of Steel revamp, both of the elder Kents weren't quite so old.  While still possessed of the same sage moral values that had always been characteristic of their pre- Crisis incarnations, the Kents were deliberately de-aged by a decade or so.  The creative team wanted both Kents to play a more active role not only in their new Superman's life, but in the larger events of the DCU.  From the late 80s onward, the Kents have relationships with heroes other than their son, appearing well beyond the pages of books exploring their roles in Superman's formative years.  They have a part to play in such blockbusters as 'The Death of Superman', 'Identity Crisis', as well as stories involving anyone wearing a Kryptonian 'S' on their chest--whether they're related to their son or not.  They are, in a real sense, the moral voice of the larger DCU, now. |||| |||| Martha Kent's current persona has tended to be influenced by K Callahan's televised portrayal on Lois and Clark:  The New Adventures of Superman , and to a perhaps lesser degree by Annette O'Toole's Smallville spin. Perhaps the best summation of the 21st century Martha Kent is someone of the approximate age and looks of O'Toole, who has the open mind and free thinking exemplified in Callahan's performance.  She has been seen pursuing many interests beyond the scope of a stereotypical farmer's wife.  In the Birthright series, she's shown to be computer literate, with an affection for paranormal web sites.  Endlessly searching for anything that might help her boy know more of who he is, it's probably fair to say she's the keeper of what TV's Chloe Sullivan would call a kind of 'Wall of Weird'. This nouveau Kent couple seems most like a marriage between a farm boy from an old farm family and a city girl attracted to that life, but nevertheless a part of the wider world.  As such, it's easier to see how both parents feed different parts of Clark's moral foundations, than perhaps with any other Ma/Pa combination."
291,Captain Atom (DC)(Post Crisis),Nathaniel  Christopher Adam ,291_20051216195022_char.jpg,"Nearly indestructible metal alloy skin, energy blasts from hands, flight, super strength, ability to absorb energy, time travel (only forward and only when he absorbs too much energy), and rapid healing.",The X-Ionizer,"Superficially, there are two different Captains Atom (the Silver/Bronze Age Captain Atom from Charlton Comics and the Modern Age Captain Atom from DC Comics).  Recent events, however, allow for the interpretation that they are, in fact, the same character--from a certain point of view. |||| |||| Pre- Crisis |||| The first Captain Atom, created by Steve Ditko at Charlton, was Captain Allen Adam, a straight-arrow, pre-Vietnam cold warrior in the US Air Force.  While testing a new missile for the AIr Force,  he got caught up in its nuclear explosion in space.  This disintegrated, then somehow reintegrated him, giving him access to the 'raw' power of atomic energy. |||| |||| This character did briefly appear in the pre- Crisis DCU, soon after the sale of Charlton characters was final.  Some effort was taken at establishing the 'Ditko Captain Atom', 'Ditko Blue Beetle', and the rest of the Charlton comics characters as being present on a the new 'Earth 4'--when the Crisis hit and made the point moot.  (Indeed, this fact was actually established in the series, Crisis on Infinite Earths .  Talk about coming to the multiverse party late...) |||| |||| Post- Crisis |||| The second Captain Atom was named Nathaniel Christopher Adam.  He was, at first, wholly different than the 'Ditko Atom'.   Convicted of a crime he didn't commit, and to avoid life imprisonment in a United States Army prison, he volunteered to work for Wade Eiling and Heinrich Megala's Captain Atom Project. This let to Nate being bonded to a living alien metal from the Silver Shield (with a little help from an atomic explosion), and being catapulted from May, 1968 to the modern day. Found by Eiling and Megala, they crafted the super-hero identity for the captain, as well as his new, but short-lived, alter ego of Cameron Scott, attempting to gain information for the United States on the various meta-humans proliferating the landscape. Captain Atom became a member of the Justice League International, formed an attachment to Nightshade, led the forces of Earth in the Invasion!, became leader of Justice League Europe, and eventually found the man who had framed him for the original crime, and revealed the truth behind the 'big lie' to the world, before being lost in time thanks to the efforts of Monarch. Captain Atom did eventually return to our time, where he led the Extreme Justice branch of the Justice League, until the time of Earth's Final Night, but Nate is still a semi-active super-hero, having recently worked with the L.A.W., free of the guilt of his crime and his original duplicity in joining the Justice League. |||| |||| This Captain Atom has an odd reaction to exposure to large amounts of energy.  He will seem to be killed, or atomized, by it--but instead is displaced by it.  Typically this displacement takes the form of time travel, neatly allowing him to 'disappear' from the DCU time-line for a while, only to return when the writers find convenient.  He also has the ability to shift dimensionally in such explosive situations.  Recently, he has been shown to cross over from the regular DCU to the Wildstorm universe, using this unique power. |||| |||| How, then, is this character related to the first Captain Atom?  As a part of his initial 'cover story'--necessary to keep the 'Captain Atom Project' a secret-- all of the adventures of the 'Ditko Captain Atom' were assigned to this Captain Atom by the US Military.  Thus, if you were to pull his file at the Pentagon, you would see the events of Captain Allen Adam's life in Captain Nathaniel Christopher Adam's records."

421,Juggernaut (Marvel)(01 - Cain Marko),Cain Marko ,421_20060314170258_char.jpg,Unstoppable force of nature.  The Juggernaut's powers originate from the crystal gem of Cytorak.,"Mind powers, only when his helmet is removed.","Cain Marko’s mother died when he was very young, leaving him to live a life of psychological and physical torment at the hands of his abusive father, atomic researcher Doctor Kurt Marko. Following the death of his colleague Doctor Brian Xavier, Kurt married Xavier's widow Sharon and he and Cain took up residence in the Xavier's Westchester mansion with Sharon and her young son, Charles. |||| |||| Kurt seemingly preferred Charles to his own son, which consumed Cain with jealousy and he took to bullying his stepbrother. Cain's father continued to beat him, but Cain did not suffer the abuse alone. Inexperienced at the use of his emerging mutant telepathic powers, Charles shared the pain and inadvertently learned of Cain's jealousy towards him. This only ensured that Cain would forever hate Charles for his unwitting betrayal. |||| |||| After an argument with his father, Cain accidentally caused a fire to engulf his father's home laboratory. Kurt saved Charles first, and then went back for Cain, reinforcing Cain's belief that his father loved Charles more than he. Kurt died of smoke inhalation, but not before warning Charles to always beware of Cain. |||| |||| Soon after, both Cain and Charles were drafted into military service and served in same unit. When Cain deserted under fire during a mission in Asia, Charles pursued, hoping to convince his stepbrother to return of his own accord. Charles followed Cain into a cave that housed the lost temple of Cyttorak, a powerful mystical entity. Therein, Cain unearthed the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak and, upon touching it, was transformed by its mystical energies into a human juggernaut. A subsequent cave-in buried Cain, and Charles believed his stepbrother dead. |||| |||| Cain eventually dug himself free and made his way to America where he sought to use his newfound strength to exact revenge on Charles. However, he was defeated on every attempt by the X-Men, a team of mutant adventurers fighting to preserve Charles’ dream of peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants. Cain then formed a criminal partnership with the mutant mercenary Black Tom Cassidy, and the pair soon became two of the world’s most wanted criminals. |||| |||| After many years of villainy, Cain was teleported to an alternate universe where he helped form the team of costumed adventurers known as the eXiles. Cain was eventually returned to his own universe, whereupon he encountered the psionic being known as Onslaught who used his enormous powers to physically hurl Cain from Canada to New York. There, he encountered the X-Men once more and was taken to Charles’ mansion for medical treatment. On waking, Cain sought out Charles to warn him of Onslaught. To his horror, Cain discovered that Onslaught was Charles who tore the Ruby of Cyttorak from Cain’s chest and trapped him within it. Therein, Cain discovered an entire plane of existence and encountered a corrupt aspect of Cyttorak. The mystic named Gomurr the Ancient sought to help free Cain from the jewel, imbuing him with the gem's power. Using his newfound strength, Cain destroyed the aspect and was freed from the gem, returning with more power than ever before. Ignoring Gomurr's warning that he was fated to destroy everything and everyone in his path, Cain returned to his villainous ways. |||| |||| Soon after, Cain heard a rumor of a second Cyttorak Gem, and, coveting its power, he returned to the Temple where he found the first. However, it was a trap set by a Cult who sought the power of the Ruby for themselves, draining Cain's power to energize their Ruby. With the assistance of Black Tom and the X-Men, Cain claimed the power of the second Ruby, but it was possessed by an evil spirit which took over his body. The spirit made Cain smash through dimensional walls in an attempt to destroy its nemesis, but the natives of the other dimension ultimately freed Cain from its possession. |||| |||| Cain eventually discovered that his becoming the Juggernaut was no accident. He had been compelled to enter the temple of Cyttorak, who was one of a pantheon of eight gods that each had an avatar on Earth. These avatars, named the Exemplars, enlisted Cain’s aid in constructing a machine that would remove humanity's free will, thus allowing their gods to rule the Earth. With Charles’ help, Cain regained control of his psyche and foiled the Exemplars’ plan. |||| |||| Cain was again cast as a hero when the sentient spaceship Prosh returned to Earth to gather a group of costumed adventurers for a journey through time to uncover the keys to preserving human evolution. Whilst in the past, Cain was shown that despite all his yearning for power, he had squandered his mystical abilities. When the team reassembled in the present, they fought and defeated the alien entity named the Stranger who sought to control the natural evolution of mankind. |||| |||| Soon after, Cain was drafted into the service of the Commission for Superhuman Activities as a super-powered bounty hunter. However, this new career was short-lived, and Cain eventually found himself working alongside Black Tom once more. Soon after, Cain requested the X-Men's help in stopping Tom, whose plant-based powers had resurfaced and flared out of control. After a brief clash with the X-Men, it came to light that Cain had been stripped of Cyttorak's mystical energies and was no longer invulnerable. Tom was defeated, but not before he knocked Cain into the surrounding waters. A young aquatic mutant named Samuel Pare saved Cain's life, forming a strong bond of friendship between the unlikely pair. When Cain was invited by his stepbrother to take up residence at the mansion, he accepted and soon came to appreciate his newfound lot in life. After assisting the X-Men on a mission, Cain joined the team. |||| |||| After Sammy was returned home to Canada, Cain defied a restraining order to visit the boy. When he learned that Sammy’s father was physically abusing him, he flew into a rage and accidentally injured Sammy’s mother. Alpha Flight arrived to defuse the situation and, on seeing a terrified young Samuel, Cain surrendered himself and was taken into custody. Incarcerated in a holding facility designed to contain superhuman criminals, Cain was appointed a lawyer in the form of Jennifer Walters, the She-Hulk. Whilst Charles discussed a plan of legal action with Walters, another of the facility's inmates - the Rhino - broke free, setting Cain loose in the process. Rather than escape, Cain stayed and defeated the Rhino in order to save the life of a guard. This heroic act, combined with the Canadian government's less than ideal incarceration methods, was enough to make a case for Cain and endear him to Walters. |||| |||| Soon after, Cain and Walters began a romantic relationship that was cut short by the arrival of Cyttorak's new avatar. With Walters’ aid, Cain defeated the new Juggernaut, but the damage he had caused during the battle forced Walters to rethink her feelings for him. An impassioned plea from Sammy’s mother led to Cain receiving a reduced sentence, as well as extradition back to the United States. Cain continued to serve as a member of the X-Men whilst undertaking community service and anger management therapy. |||| |||| After the recent decimation of the mutant population following 'M-Day,' Cain journeyed to England where he joined a new incarnation of the British super-team Excalibur. ||||"

M'Baku's mystically augmented powers include super-human strength, speed, stamina, agility and durability",,"M'Baku was one of Wakanda's greatest warriors, second only to his then friend T'Challa (Black Panther). M'Baku greatly disliked T'Challa's technological revitalization of Wakanda and sought to have all technology outlawed so the nation could return to its natural primitivism of several decades before. M'Baku had a contingent of supporters who shared this view. While T'Challa was on a leave of absence from the throne in order to serve in the Avengers in America, M'Baku plotted to usurp the throne. Wakandan culture was traditionally ruled by its greatest warrior. M'Baku therefor sought out to defeat T'Challa by reviving the outlawed White Gorilla cult, and to personally stalk and kill one of the rare white gorillas living in the jungles near Wakanda. Bathing in the gorilla's blood and eating the gorilla's flesh mystically endowed its great strength upon M'Baku. |||| |||| When the T'Calla returned with select members of the Avengers, M'Baku, calling himself the Man-Ape, openly challenged the Panther's right to rule. In the battle that ensued M'Baku succeeded in defeating the Panther. However, when he bound T'Challa to the giant statue of a panther which was the Panther cult's major totem and tried to topple it upon his enemy, the statue instead crumbled, burying him. |||| |||| The believed dead Man-Ape was revived by his supporter N'Gamo and set out to track the Panther down and gain retribution. He tracked him to New York. There the Man-Ape allied himself with the Lethal Legion, kidnapped Monica Lynne, the Black Panther's American girlfriend, and sent word to T'Challa that he would have to engage him once more in mortal combat to free her. Through treachery, M'Baku once again bested the Panther, taking the Panther captive. When the Avengers came to the T'Challa's rescue, the Lethal Legion managed to ensnare them. Eventually, the Avengers broke free and defeated their captors, and Captain America physically bested the Man-Ape. |||| |||| T'Challa decreed that the Man-Ape could never return to Wakanda without facing penalty of death. Humiliated, the Man-Ape never risked the attempt and instead wandered the less civilized parts of the world, performing mercenary work to survive. He was eventually contacted again by the Grim Reaper, who was trying to assemble a new Lethal Legion to exact revenge upon the Avengers. The Man-Ape was assigned to free Goliath from his incarceration on the West Coast Avengers Compound. Succeeding in the task, the Man-Ape allied with the Legion until the Reaper's racist attitudes prompted him to abandon the Legion's cause. |||| Later, M'Baku joined a new incarnation of the Masters of Evil, but was defeated by the Thunderbolts."

Scorpio went after his brother, Nick Fury, with his new group, but was defeated by The Defenders and Moon Knight. |||| |||| The Zodiac LMD's were recruited by Quicksilver during his bout with temporary insanity, and Quicksilver ordered the Zodiac LMD's to destory The Avengers for their imagined wrong doings. The Avengers managed to defeat the group and most were remanded into federal custody. |||| |||| The android Zodiac were soon released, and the Scorpio LMD rebuilt a number of them. Scorpio used the Zodiac Key to create LMDs that exemplified the forces and personalities inherent in each sign, hoping to create great strength in the combination of all twelve traits of the Zodiac. |||| |||| At some point the android Zodiac captured and presumably killed the human Scorpio, Jacques LaPoint. Jacob Fury's Scorpio android then impersonated him and infiltrated the original, human Zodiac organization. He arranged the ambush in which the android Zodiac killed all of the remaining human Zodiac leaders except Cornelius van Lunt, alias Taurus. It was later revealed the Libra had also survived the attack on the original Zodiac Cartel. |||| |||| Immediately afterward, Van Lunt sought out the services of the Avengers' West Coast branch to confront and defeat the android Zodiac. In their initial foray, the Avengers failed, although several androids were destroyed. Sagittarius, in particular, was destroyed and replaced with an LMD replica of the Avengers’ Hawkeye. Hawkeye's LMD was used to infiltrate the Avengers' headquarters, and Scorpio also made a Leo LMD in the form of the Avengers’ Tigra for additional infiltration. This new Leo LMD helped the Zodiac gain an upper hand when the Avengers tracked the Zodiac to their refuge in Death Valley, California, but the first android Leo took offence at being replaced. He battled Scorpio directly, seemingly destroying him. |||| |||| The Zodiac Key immediately resurrected the Scorpio LMD. Claiming superiority and believing that the Zodiac would eventually kill the Avengers as the androids could never be stopped, Scorpio wanted to use the Key to transport everyone on the scene to the Key's native dimension where the conflict, he believed, could be prolonged indefinitely. However, when the androids were in the other dimension, they ceased to function because each of them were aligned with a particular zodiacal energy, energy that did not exist in the other dimension. The Avengers found Hawkeye and Tigra had been sent to the same dimension and, reunited, the team was sent back to Earth by the Brotherhood. However, secretly the Brotherhood waited so that someday they could also send the Key to Earth again and create new conflicts for them."
