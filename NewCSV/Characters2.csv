1562,Hydro-Man (Marvel)(01 - Morrie Bench),Morris 'Morrie' Bench ,1562_20081209021351_char.jpg,"Hydro-Man can transform himself wholly or partially into a water-like liquid substance, the particles of which he can mentally animate and manipulate at will. By generating force from within this fluid, he can emit high-pressure water blasts like a fire hose. Bench mentally controls every drop of his bodily liquid; his watery form will gradually reintegrate if it has been vaporized or otherwise dispersed. He can merge with or absorb ordinary, existing water in his environment, often using it to increase his mass and volume. Bench's strength is slightly enhanced by his abnormal physiology. Recent alterations of his powers by the Wizard have enabled Bench to mentally manipulate water sources outside his own body, and have given him a finer degree of control over his own fluid form. However, the Wizard also intentionally weakened Bench's molecular cohesion, and developed a device enabling him to reduce Bench to an inert mass of liquid if necessary, ensuring Hydro-Man's loyalty.",,"Cargo ship crewman Morrie Bench was accidentally knocked overboard by Spider-Man (who was battling Sub-Mariner) during the testing of a powerful new experimental underwater generator, the energies of which combined with gases from undersea volcanoes to trigger a weird mutation in Bench, who began to transform into living water. Physically and emotionally unstable, Bench dubbed himself Hydro-Man and soon attacked Spider-Man, but he evaporated after Spider-Man scattered his liquid form amidst the hot sunshine of the New York rooftops; however, the particles of Bench's body soon reintegrated, and he embarked on a long criminal career. |||| |||| When Bench and rival criminal Sandman fought over the affections of barfly Sadie Frickett, the two men accidentally merged into a monstrous 'mud-thing' that the police were ultimately forced to dehydrate into seemingly inert rubble.Hydro-Man and Sandman eventually managed to separate back into their original forms, but both were humiliated and traumatized by the experience. Sandman was so shaken that he went straight for years (until the Wizard brainwashed him into returning to crime), while Hydro-Man did most of his criminal work in groups from that point on, perhaps seeking safety in numbers. |||| |||| Both alone and as a member of teams like the Sinister Syndicate, the Frightful Four and the Assembly of Evil, Bench fought a wide array of foes such as Silver Sable, Sandman, the Fantastic Four, Cloak & Dagger, the Avengers, the New Warriors, Thunderstrike, the Thunderbolts, Gambit and Black Panther, but most often clashed with Spider-Man. Hydro-Man was one of many super-criminals employed by corrupt billionaire Justin Hammer for a time, and later served in the Masters of Evil assembled by Hammer's daughter Justine, alias the Crimson Cowl; however, after Justine's arrest and the apparent death of Justin, Hammer Industries phased out its criminal enterprises and Bench, along with fellow employee the Shocker, was laid off. The Shocker and Hydro-Man then teamed up for one last crime, seeking enough money to retire, but Hydro-Man's thirst for revenge against Spider-Man led to their defeat. Trying and failing to go straight, Bench was recruited back into the Wizard's Frightful Four and, more recently, the Sinister Twelve."

O'Brian escaped, and stumbled his way to monastery, where the brothers nurtured his mind and nursed his body back to health.  When he recovered, he discovered that the chemicals had transformed him into a human rubber-band. |||| O'Brian reformed his criminal ways after gaining his Plastic Man abilities. |||| He was invited to join the JLA by Batman.  When the JLA members were split into their hero and civilian identities, it was 'Eel' O'Brian who gathered the civilians to re-merge with their hero alter-egos because he did not want to return to a life of crime. |||| Plastic Man was shattered in the distant past when the JLA went to rescue Aquaman and the time-displaced Atlantis.

7101,Master of the World (Marvel),Eshu ,7101_20070809000741_char.jpg,"The Master of the World is approximately 40,000 years old. After he was experimented on by the Plodex ship, he gained different powers. The master has the agility beyond that of a normal human, which he gained after he altered his body. He has enhanced reflexes, that were fast enough to slice Warbird with a sword. His speed can reach 61- 65 mph. His stamina is so high that he can sustain peak physical extertion for several hours before fatigue impairs performance. Also, his strength is enhanced, and he was able to break Sasquatch's arm by, after dodging Sasquatch's attack, grabbing it with both hands and breaking it. He is also a master of hand to hand combat, as he learned the techniques 40,000 years ago. He knows all human pressure points, which was shown when he knocked out Namor the Sub-Mariner with a single punch. His suit also has many benefits, allowing him teleportation and flight. His helmet and battlesuit are composed of an unknown metal, including cybernetic mesh enabling the Master to control Plodex technology through mental commands. Devices within the Master’s helmet and battlesuit enable him to cast illusions disguising his appearance. He is able to create a force field that can ward off attacks. Also, he is able to shoot energy blasts with his suit, and it enables him to disperse electromagnetism, which was shown when he was able to control Guardian I's suit.",,"Forty thousand years ago, a caveman named Eshu was cast out of his tribe. He wanders the Earth and is soon psionically called to a beacon of an alien ship. |||| |||| The ship was owned by the Plodex race. After it crashed on the North Pole, it sent out a message, to seek out the dominant life form on Earth. After an exhausting journey, Eshu finds the ship and is captured upon entering it. For thousands of years Eshu was experimented on by the Plodex ship. The experiments were excruciating. He was dissected and reassembled, just to be dissected again. He became more and more intelligent over the years he was experimented on until his mind and body were developed to the peak of perfection, and after some time learned to tap into the ship's systems with his mind, which eventually enables him to take them all over. He finds he is actually unable to leave the ship. He sends out a signal to a member of the Plodex race called Marrina. She responds and brings the superhero team Alpha Flight with her. By this time, Eshu is calling himself The Master of the World. His plans succeed and the Master is able to escape the ship by submarine. |||| |||| He was no longer bound to the alien ship, but in order to execute his plans for world domination, he would still need the ship's technology. Using his knowledge of the alien technologies, he gains control of Marrina and her Plodex Mate. Alpha Flight's Puck and Marrina, assisted by Namor, the Sub-Mariner, thwarted his plans to dominate the world. The Master vanishes for a short time. |||| |||| It turned out that he escaped, and in order to preserve his body, entered a state of suspended animation. He was revived from that state by Llan the Sorcerer, and with the help of enzymes from the corpse of Scramble, the Mixed Up Man, rebuilds his body to a perfect human specimen. His next plan was to take over the Canadian government with the alias Joshua Lord, because of the chaos that was trigerred by the Super Power Registration Act. During that time The Master reforms Omega Flight to stop Alpha Flight from getting in his way. The Master finds James MacDonald Hudson entrapped in some sort of dimensional limbo. He returns him from the dead as The Antiguard, in order for The Guardian to kill Alpha Flight and his wife. However, The Guardian, with the help of his wife Heather Hudson, managed to break out of the Master's mental control. The Master seemingly kills himself to avoid prison. |||| |||| He returns, to cross paths Heroes For Hire and the mercenary team headed by Silver Sable. One of his goals was to kill Iron Fist. This is because the mystical land of K'un Lun, which manifests where Iron Fist is, poses a threat to his plans. He again apparently kills himself, but his death was proven false again. He appears during the Kang Dynasty storyline, where Marrina is glimpsed inside a stasis tube in his laboratory. His alien technology is used in an attempt to protect the cities of the world, but this does not stop earth from being conquered. |||| |||| The Master dies again, seemingly, at the hands of Warbird."

As The Enforcer, Merkyn captured the super-hero known as Firestorm, who ultimately escaped and captured Merkyn in turn.

'Rudy' Jones ,904_20060928183937_char.jpg,"Absorbs the energy, powers, and knowledge of those he touches.",,"The Rudy Jones Parasite had several distinct phases of existence.  From 1987-95 he was merely a S.T.A.R. labs janitor who was exposed to chemicals which Darkseid used to impart the power of absorption to Jones.  This experience left him with the vampire-like need to consume energy to live.  He was eventually captured and put into a laboratory to prevent him from using his powers. In 1995, though, he broke out of confinement and merged with his scientist babysitter, Dr. Freeman, to permanently join the ranks of the most intelligent villains in the DCU. A third being--a shapeshifter--was added to this already-combined being a few years later.  This allowed him to not just steal a person's power, but to perfectly mimic their appearance as well.  He posed as Lois Lane for a considerable length of  time. |||| He appeared to die after Superman unmasked his charade."
133,Shadow Thief (DC),Carl Sands ,133_20071026232154_char.jpg,,,"While growing up in Japan, American Carl Sands learned ninjutsu techniques and became a rather undistinguished industrial saboteur, accepting unremarkable sums to hinder and eliminate his clients' rivals. The Thanagarian criminal Byth then hired Sands to steal Hawkman and Hawkwoman's ship. To help Sands with this job, Byth gave him a Dimensiometer - a Thanagarian belt device/'shadow vest', which gave Sands the ability to shift his body into a shadow form. (His pre-Crisis history is still canon, including his brief membership in the Injustice Gang, and fought the Golden Age Hawks instead.) |||| |||| Hawkman eventually defeated him, but Shadow-Thief would come into conflict with him many times after that. He would later become a member of the Injustice Gang which came into conflict with Hawkman and his allies, the Justice League of America. He lost the belt to the Phantom Stranger, but he gained a shadow suit. He eventually sold his soul to Neron for more power. Neron gave him a more powerful shadow suit with the ability to turn other people and objects into shadows. |||| |||| Recently, the Shadow-Thief has entered into the employ of St. Roch art trader Kristopher Roderic. Sands has been sent to the ends of the earth in service of Roderic's dark aims, and is hopeful that the unscrupulous collector will help him with a problem of his own. |||| |||| During the events of Identity Crisis, Shadow-Thief became deranged and began having delusional conversations with the Dimensiometer. He ended up apparently killing Firestorm with Shining Knight's mystically enhanced sword. For killing Firestorm, he was prosecuted by Kate Spencer (a.k.a. Manhunter IX). |||| |||| Shadow-Thief later popped up as a member of the Injustice League, and is one of the villains featured in Salvation Run"

He served for many cases until he was controlled by the Joker and resigned rather than face the shame.  He faded away for quite some time, resurfacing occasionally until the alien invasion happened.  He was one of a group kidnapped by aliens and tested for the meta-gene.  Turns out he had one.  He spend the next several years tooling around outer space.  Most recently, he has become pals with Hourman and seems to have eschewed his more serious and heroic side and settled back to being a bum again."
388,"John 'J.' Jonah Jameson, Jr. (Marvel)",,388_20060504073417_char.jpg,,,"The step-son of an abusive veteran, Jameson began his journalism career as a paperboy, then copy boy for the Daily Bugle, formerly edited by old man Jameson, whom some presume to have been his father. A sullen and bullying student, he quit school after becoming a reporter. At twenty he uncovered police corruption by supposed department hero Sam Kenner; beaten and bombed, Jameson nonetheless exposed Kenner with the help of Bugle owner William Goodman. He became a full-time Bugle reporter, including a stint as a war correspondent, criticizing most costumed heroes as glory-seeking vigilantes upstaging the common man. Marrying his high school sweetheart Joan, Jameson rose to editor-in-chief and became renowned for supporting civil rights and opposing organized crime. When Goodman's heirs put the Bugle up for sale, Jameson tapped his last dollar and made the newspaper his own. He worked hard to support his wife and their son John, eventually becoming a millionaire member in New York's elite Century Club; although earning a reputation as a notorious miser, he supported many charities and often helped employees in true need. Still a reporter at heart, he ventured to Korea for a story but was crushed when Joan was killed by a masked gunman in his absence; this and other self-perceived failures contributed to his distrust of masked heroes and the heroic ideal. |||| |||| In recent years, when the superhuman performer Spider-Man became a crimefighter, Jameson vowed to expose him as a publicity-seeking scofflaw, and not even the rescue of John from a space flight disaster dissuaded him. He relied on photos from Peter Parker, not knowing he was employing Spider-Man himself. Jameson heralded the Spacemen as superior heroes, but this gambit failed when Spider-Man exposed them as criminals; support for Mysterio yielded similar results. Despite his many achievements, Jameson's harsh self-analysis weighed upon him, for his hatred of Spider-Man was motivated by fear that he was indeed the selfless hero Jameson could never be. Jameson hired Dr. Farley Stillwell to mutate investigator Mac Gargan into the Scorpion to defeat Spider-Man, but the debacle left Stillwell dead and the insane Scorpion hating Jameson. Plagued by guilt, the publisher confessed his actions to his friend Norman Osborn. Scientist Spencer Smythe soon offered Jameson the first of many Spider-Slayer robots, with which he battled Spider-Man to a standstill before the web-slinger escaped. Jameson rallied New York against the Kingpin's crime wave; abducted for his insolence, he remained defiant before being rescued by Spider-Man. |||| |||| Months later, Osborn, the Green Goblin, seemingly died in battle with Spider-Man; Jameson suspected Spider-Man of outright murder, hiring Luke Cage to bring the wall-crawler in, but desisted when John became the Man-Wolf. Jameson's obsession paled before concern for his son, but his own safety became an issue when he was attacked by the Grizzly, a violent wrestler he had blacklisted a decade before. Spider-Man rescued Jameson but chided him for the grudge; in response, Jameson hired Daniel Berkhart to harass Spider-Man as Mysterio's supposed ghost. When this failed, he contracted Farley Stillwell's brother Harlan to mutate a new operative, but fugitive Rick Deacon usurped the process and became the criminal Fly, killing Stillwell and becoming an enemy of Spider-Man and Jameson alike. Jameson mysteriously received photos depicting Spider-Man with the body of Peter Parker; the photos, sent by Osborn's drug-maddened son Harry, were actually of a clone. Jonah nevertheless kept them quiet but stepped up his traditional campaigns. He approached Dr. Marla Madison to construct her own Spider-Slayer but met no better success. Finally confronting Parker, whom he imagined had been slain and replaced by Spider-Man, Jameson believed his story of faked photography. His relationship with Madison turned romantic, and he proved his principles anew by denouncing the terrorists of the People's Liberation Front. The PLF responded by hiring the Hitman, but even in the face of death Jameson ridiculed his abductors, who were defeated by Spider-Man and the Punisher. |||| |||| Meanwhile, Smythe, whose obsession had outgrown even Jameson's, learned he was dying and resolved to take Jameson and Spider-Man with him to the grave. He mesmerized the Man-Wolf into abducting Jameson and fighting Spider-Man; Jameson believed John dead when he saw his son teleported away. Smythe suddenly shackled Jonah and Spider-Man with a bomb, dying afterward. Jameson broke down, admitting his obsession had harmed him far more than its subject, but Spider-Man deactivated the bomb, leaving Jameson devastated at his confession. Scientist Jonas Harrow targeted Jonah, driving him mad, but his tenacity challenged even Harrow, and after being rescued by Spider-Man, Jameson was soon his typically paranoid self. Months later, John resurfaced alive, barely remembering his extradimensional adventures, and Jameson was overjoyed with his son's cure. Longtime colleague Ian Fate resurfaced as a sorcerer in the company of the monstrous Man-Thing; naively expecting Jameson to help reshape the world, Fate lashed out when refused, but while Spider-Man fought the Man-Thing, Jameson calmed Fate and set him on a more peaceful path. Jameson himself returned to basics by investigating waterfront extortion, interrogating no less than the Kingpin and risking his life to uncover the perpetrators, albeit with unexpected assistance from Spider-Man. Perhaps in unconscious gratitude, Jameson's subsequent scheme to discredit Spider-Man with impostors proved half-hearted at best. |||| |||| The Hobgoblin, secretly Jameson's Century Club crony Roderick Kingsley, learned Osborn's secrets and tried to blackmail Jameson over the Scorpion's mutation. Spider-Man ended this scheme, but the conscience-stricken Jameson publicly revealed his guilt anyway, then married Marla Madison. Soon afterward, he hired the alleged mutant hunters X-Factor and the mercenary Wild Pack to bring in Spider-Man but, more at peace than he had been in years, he seemed content to restrict his castigations to the printed page. However, his vendetta literally took new form when the Chameleon imprisoned and impersonated him, bringing anti-Spider-Man sentiments to new heights. Inevitably rescued by Spider-Man, he found a new crisis awaiting him, for Thomas Fireheart, secretly the mercenary Puma, acquired the Bugle to build up Spider-Man's reputation. Jameson sought solace in his lifelong convictions, denigrating neo-Nazi Eric Hartmann in print; when Hartmann's forces invaded the Bugle, for once Jameson played the rescuer when he downed Hartmann before the madman could shoot the intervening Spider-Man. |||| |||| Fireheart eventually returned the Bugle to Jameson, but his control was wrested away by Norman Osborn, alive after all, but Jameson nonetheless investigated the mutant-hunting Operation: Zero Tolerance. Hoping to placate the publisher, the android-human Bastion offered him the outlaw X-Men's secrets, but Jameson refused, as his distaste for prejudice outweighed even his dislike of costumed heroes. The X-Men defeated Bastion, but Jameson was scarcely short of enemies when Osborn hired Daniel Berkhart, who had joined Mysterio's cousin Maguire Beck in the identity of Mad Jack, to force Jameson to sell the Bugle. Soon afterward, when Venom was ordered to put a scare into him, the madman mistook his instructions for a kill order, and even Jameson winced at the beating Spider-Man took in his defense. |||| |||| Jameson regained the Bugle when Osborn went mad in a mystic ritual, which also empowered teenager Mattie Franklin, who became a new Spider-Woman and was, ironically, entrusted to the care of the Jamesons. A different legacy hounded Jameson as Spencer Smythe's even madder son Alistair threatened Jameson's family before receiving his latest defeat. Berkhart and Beck, now Mysterio and Mad Jack, abducted Jameson but were outwitted by Spider-Man and Daredevil. Unencumbered by gratitude, he sought to capitalize on the revelation of Daredevil's secret identity but was undercut when reporter Ben Urich refused to participate. Jameson hired superhuman investigator Jessica Jones to break a similar story on Spider-Man, but Jones merely put his money to work for charity, making her later rescue of Mattie from drug dealers all the more biting. |||| |||| Even Jameson began to face his vendetta's futility, and his invective grew sparse. After fresh humiliation in a libel trial, he agreed to a new Bugle feature with a theoretically objective focus on super heroes, co-managed by Urich and Jones, but he was stunned by seeming proof that his son John had, inexplicably, been Spider-Man all along. Jameson's hatred of Spider-Man can only intensify when he inevitably learns the truth. |||| |||| Resigned from being a mayor in Superior Spider-Man #31."
36271,Cookie Malone,,36271_20140524193050_char.jpg,* Unarmed Combat,,"Cookie Malone is a Canadian cook who lived in the same mining camp as a young Wolverine. He is featured in the Origin series. |||| |||| After Rose and Logan arrived at the Alberta mining camp (where they were taking refuge after fleeing Logan's childhood home), Logan soon met Cookie Malone, an overweight cook who was being accused of keeping extra rations for himself while leaving the rest of the camp hungry.  These accusations of selfishness became apparently well-founded when,  in two different points of the series, he is shown to be robbing people's homes. |||| |||| Logan first ran into Cookie as a teenager.  Logan was having trouble handling a cart full of stone after its wheel hit a bump in the downhill road he was on.  Cookie ran up the hill to help him, only to turn on him and dump the stones over the side of the hill.  Logan and Cookie would have more confrontations, with Cookie bullying a submissive Logan. |||| |||| Eventually, Logan became very popular at the camp and Cookie was jealous of the attention.  To get back at Logan, he cut the dynamite fuses short.  This resulted in the tragic deaths of some workers, not including Logan.  Logan was trapped under the rubble, but survived due to his healing factor.  During the funeral for the workers who weren't as fortunate as Logan, the Canucklehead himself caught Cookie robbing a home in the camp.  This was the first time Logan was violent towards Cookie, and from here the tables turned. |||| |||| At the end of the Origin series, there is a cage fight tournament at the local pub and both Cookie and Logan enter.  They meet each other in the semi-finals and, aided by a crooked gambler, Cookie opens the bout with a metal-knuckled punch to Logan's head.  Cookie taunted Logan and was then beaten relentlessly, with Logan only barely sparing Cookie's life. |||| ||||"

199,Quicksilver (Marvel),Pietro Maximoff ,199_20070103021229_char.jpg,"Quicksilver possessed superhuman speed, and could travel on foot at speed exceeding the speed of sound for hundreds of miles before tiring; he could 'fly' for short distances by flapping his arms or 'vibrating' his legs; he could also use his speed to create cyclones, dodge machine gun and laser fire, and run up walls and across water. When the High Evolutionary's Isotope E upgraded his powers, he did not know the true limits of his speed. |||| Following the loss of his mutant nature, Quicksilver exposed himself to the Terrigen Mists, resulting in him now possessing the power to vibrate his atoms so quickly he travels forward in time. His molecular speed that he generates displaces him out of the mainstream time/space so that he is able to propel himself into the future. He can leap from an hour to up to twelve days, and remain for several minutes to several hours before being recalled to his present time once his body tires, or he can return at will before his time is up. As he returns from his trip, he returns the exact moment he left so as to appear that he has been gone for half a nano-second. He is able to bring inorganic objects from the future back to his correct time, although it has yet been shown what would happen if he attempted to bring organic objects with him. These new powers are having an affect on his physical health. Each time he meets up with his future self (if indeed the person he meets is his future self), the future self looks more and more haggard. |||| |||| After the incident on Genosha, Pietro continued to inhale the Mists of Terrigen and has apparently obtained the power, with the shards of the Mists in his hands, to restore other mutants powers.",,"Pietro and his twin sister, Wanda, were raised by Django and Marya Maximoff, a gypsy couple. As adolescents, Pietro and his sister Wanda discovered that they had peculiar talents. When Django began to steal food to feed his starving family, enraged villagers attacked the gypsy camp. Using his phenomenal speed, Pietro fled from the camp with his sister. The next few years, Wanda and Pietro wandered central Europe, living off the land. One day, Wanda accidentally caused a house to burst into flames with her uncontrollable hex powers, and the pair was chased by superstitious townspeople. Despite Pietro's attempt to defend her, the twins were soon overpowered and were rescued by Magneto (Magnus). |||| |||| Unwilling but believing they owned him a debt, the twins became members of Magneto's Brotherhood of Evil Mutants as Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. For months, they served in the Brotherhood, coming into conflict with the X-Men. When the extraterrestrial Stranger transported Magneto from Earth, the siblings left the Brotherhood. They learned the Avengers were seeking new members, and Quicksilver convinced his sister to leave for America and join the hero team. Alongside Captain America and Hawkeye, they remained with the Avengers for many years. They separated from the team only once, when Magneto manipulated Pietro and his sister into joining with him once again, but they soon realized the deception left. They then rejoined the Avengers during a conflict with the extra-dimensional Arkon. |||| |||| Eventually, Wanda began to become romantically involved with the Vision, and Pietro condemned her relationship with a pseudo-human android, causing their first major rift. The rift was later mended, some time after Wanda married the Vision, when the telepath Moondragon permanently altered Pietro's prejudice toward the Vision in a self-righteous employment of her powers. |||| |||| Pietro left the Avenges while the group was engaged in battle with the mutant-hunting Sentinel robots. Sustaining injuries in battle, Pietro was taken to medical care by Crystal, member of the Inhumans and whose dimension-spanning companion Lockjaw happened upon the scene of the battle. Months passed before Pietro was well enough to contact his companions to tell them of his circumstances. In the meantime, Pietro became romantically involved with his rescuer, and he and Crystal were married after a brief courtship. The wedding, held in the Inhuman city of Attilan, was attended by the Inhumans, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four. |||| |||| The Golden Age hero Whizzer knew of the exploits of Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, believing them to be his children whom he abandoned when his wife, Miss America, died in childbirth on Wundagore Mountain. Feeling guilty, however, he made no effort to contact them, until the day he sought the Avengers help in saving his other son, Nuklo. Wanda had come to believe the Whizzer was her father, but Pietro remained dubious. |||| |||| Months later, however, after being mystically abducted by Django Maximoff and freed by Avengers, Wanda and Pietro took a leave of absence from the team to investigate the secrets regarding their childhood origins. Returning to Wundagore Mountain, they met Bova and learned the truth of their parentage-- they were, in fact, the children of Magneto. His wife, the gypsy Magda, had fled from Magneto, terrified of the sudden manifestation of his power and intentions of world domination. Magda found her way to the tiny nation of Transia, finding refuge with Bova, a woman evolved from a cow by Wundagore’s High Evolutionary. Magda gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl, with Bova as her midwife, but was still afraid of her husband, and left Bova her children. Several nights later, a vacationing couple (the Whizzer and Miss America in their civilian identities) also needed refuge as the wife midwife assistance. Unfortunately, the couple's child was stillborn, and Miss America died in childbirth. Bova hoped to award Magda’s children to him instead, but the Whizzer fled from Wundagore upon hearing of his wife's death, nearly insane with grief. Bova instead presented the twins to the High Evolutionary, who found Django and Marya Maximoff, a gypsy couple camped nearby who had lost their own twin children, Ana and Mateo, during World War II. They cared for the children as their own. |||| |||| Their abduction by Django also led to the revelation that Wanda held a connection to the demon Chthon, who was trapped within Wundagore Mountain and hoped to escape using Wanda as a host body someday. The return to the mountain allowed Chthon to possess Wanda, but she was soon freed by her brother, the Avengers, and Django Maximoff, who sealed Chthon inside Wundagore before dying. |||| |||| Pietro and Crystal soon had their own child, a daughter, Luna. Not long after, Pietro was confronted by Magneto who wanted to investigate his grandchild's birth. Pietro denounced Magneto for his callous treatment of them when they were members of this Brotherhood and refused to believe he and amended his megalomaniacal ways. Eventually, however, when Magneto appeared to be reforming, Pietro relented in his resentment for his natural father. |||| |||| Pietro had also volunteered his services to the head of the Inhumans’ small militia and became an officer. During his period of service, however, the Inhuman had no call for military activity. His neglect of his wife led her to become involved with another man. Learning of her infidelity, Pietro refused to forgive her and fled Attilan, vowing vengeance. He later tried unsuccessfully to frame the Avengers for treason, using the opportunity to attack the Avengers alongside the android Zodiac Cartel. He relented only after the Vision asked him if he was willing to orphan his and Wanda's infant children. Pietro later allied with the Hungarian government and assisted them in the development of techniques to create super-powered individuals. He proclaimed to believe fully in mutant supremacy and intended to rule the world as its self-proclaimed King of Mutants. He again tried to capture his Avengers teammates, but they escaped. |||| |||| +++ X-FACTOR +++ |||| |||| Distraught and addled, Pietro was accosted by the original X-Factor team, who were posing as mutant-hunters at the time. X-Factor helped restore Pietro to the Inhumans, whereupon it was discovered that his criminal insanity had been artificially inflicted by Maximus the Mad, who had been influencing Pietro's actions since he split with Crystal. Maximus was defeated and Pietro remained with the Inhumans. He secretly renewed alliance with Avengers, however, and publicly pretended to rejoin Magneto in order to watch over and influence his sister, Wanda, who had at the time gone mad and rejoined Magneto's service. With Avengers, he helped free Wanda from exploitation by Magneto and Immortus, restoring her to sanity. Pietro then remained alongside the Avengers for another long tenure, remaining estranged from Crystal and the Inhumans. |||| |||| Pietro later joined the U.S. government-sponsored X-Factor team, serving with the team throughout its public existence. At one point, during psychotherapy with Doc Samson, Pietro explained how his prickly personality stems largely from his frustration at dealing with a world where almost everyone and everything seems slow or stupid or both. When X-Factor was dropped from government sponsorship and forced to operate underground, Pietro left. |||| |||| When the Avengers were attacked by the alien Brethren, Pietro returned to aid the Avengers and found Crystal had also joined the team at the same time. Pietro refused to join the team since Crystal remained with them, although he later rejoined while participating in the rescue of his daughter Luna from Magneto's former Acolyte, Fabian Cortez, and his rival, Exodus. Pietro was gravely injured by Exodus and saved by the Avenger Black Knight, who by then was entertaining romantic intentions with Crystal. Recovering from his injuries at the Avengers Mansion, Pietro tried to win back Crystal. Ultimately, however, he began to repair his relationship with Crystal only after the Black Knight left Avengers. |||| |||| Soon afterward, Crystal and the other Avengers seemingly sacrificed themselves to stop the psychic menace of Onslaught. Pietro remained alongside the X-Men for a while before professing to wanting to track down other former Avengers. Instead, however, Pietro refused to join or to continue any form of the Avengers in retaliation from the government's anti-mutant legislation introduced in the wake of Onslaught. |||| |||| Again confronting Exodus and Magneto's Acolytes, Pietro joined the High Evolutionary in repelling their attack on Wundagore. Pietro was asked to become the leader of a small band of the Evolutionary's Knights of Wundagore, animals that the geneticist had endowed with human intelligence and humanoid-like forms. Pietro accepted and exhibited an adeptness at leading the Knights in battles against injustice, although he soon left in order to find his true self. |||| |||| When the heroes who were believed dead returned to Earth, Pietro and Crystal were reunited. Both helped the Avenges reassemble and accepted the status of reserve members. Pietro would return to assist the Avengers on occasional missions. |||| |||| Not long afterward, Magneto was given control of the island nation of Genosha. Investigating his father's activities, Pietro was captured by resistance forces and would have been killed if not for the intervention of the X-Men Rogue and the former Acolyte Amelia Voght. After Magneto crushed the resistance, Pietro was ready to storm off when Voght teleported him to a Genoshan camp for those mutants infected with the Legacy Virus. Horrified, Pietro chose to stay in Genosha and act as his father's conscience, to remind him that both mutants and humans have to right not to be persecuted. He accepted a cabinet-level position in Magneto's new regime. This was all according to Magneto's plan, as he hoped to make Pietro into a loyal and subservient son. During his time with Magneto, Pietro was exposed to the mutagenic Isotope E, which boosted his powers to unforeseen levels. However, Pietro could no longer stomach his father's ruthless methods after witnessing him in battle against a Genoshan Resistance. He briefly warned the X-Men about Magneto and rejoined the Avengers. |||| |||| Recently, Wanda went mad, causing the deaths of Ant-Man, the Vision and Hawkeye, and though subdued, she remained a serious threat to the world. Quicksilver was shocked to find out that the Avengers and X-Men were deliberating over whether to kill his sister. |||| |||| Enraged, Quicksilver went to Genosha to find his sister, who had been taken into their father's care, and trying to make everything right, he convinced his sister to use her reality warping powers to make the 'House of M', an alternate reality where mutants ruled. Magneto and his family were the rulers of this new world, and everything seemed to be going well until some renegade heroes informed the royal family of how the world had been before. Magneto's anger caused him to slay Quicksilver who was brought back to life quickly by a distraught Scarlet Witch. Magneto seemed to have calmed her down when Quicksilver's sister changed reality back to it's previous state. However this time, blaming all her heartache on the powers she and her family possessed, the phrase she uttered to bring back reality removed millions of mutants' powers, Quicksilver included. |||| |||| Unable to cope with a world he felt was going too slow, Quicksilver went back to the Inhumans a wreck, and was convinced to use the Mists of Terrigen to gain powers once more. He succeeded in gaining new and fantastic powers and took his daughter Luna with him to Earth, via Lockjaw. There he took the stolen Mists and used them on Unus, Freakshow, Shola, Wicked, Callisto, and other de-powered mutants still living in Genosha. Soon he gave the de-powered mutants their powers back and encountered the Office of National Emergency and was teleported away once again by Lockjaw. However Pietro was not satisfied and continued to use the Mists which caused shards of the Mist to become imbedded in his hands which he used to give the Reaper his powers back. His next move is unknown."

719,Black Canary (DC)(02 - Dinah Laurel Lance),Dinah Laurel Lance ,719_20051208022954_char.jpg,"One of the most highly skilled hand-to-hand combatants in the DC universe.  She's also in possession of the 'canary cry', an ultrasonic blast of great power.",Older men.,"The current holder of the Black Canary mantle. Daughter of Dinah Drake Lance, the original Black Canary. |||| |||| Dinah Lance was born into a family of crime fighters; her mother was a vigilante and her father is a cop. She grew up with the company of heroes, and after years of training, followed in her parent's footsteps by assuming the costume, identity and legacy of her mother Dinah Drake, the Black Canary. |||| |||| Post-Crisis she is the only one of the two Canaries to have had a relationship with Oliver Queen (the Green Arrow) - one that started when she was maybe 20 and he about 35. She was a founding member of the JLA and the Birds of Prey. Also, her mother, Dinah Drake Lance (Black Canary - 01) is dead. |||| |||| Pre-Crisis her history is a good deal more complicated. She's still the daughter of Black Canary (01), but she spent much of her formative years in the Thunderbolt's dimension.  Apparently, her sonic cry, as a baby, was so uncontrolled, that the only solution was to remove her entirely from the 'real' plane of existence.  While in this other dimension, though, she was kept maturing in a state of suspended animation. In order to keep the parents from worrying about their child, Johnny's Thunderbolt removed all knowledge from them that they had done any of this. They returned to Earth-2 believing that their child had died.  Years later, after Dinah Drake Lance had moved to Earth-1 when her husband died, Black Canary (01) became exposed to radiation that was killing her. Not knowing how to save her, Superman learned of Thunderbolt's earlier deception. Together, they decided to transfer Black Canary (01)'s life essence into the body of her daughter.  They also intrigued to keep this act of transference from Dinah once the process was complete. Thus, Black Canary (01) literally became her daughter. Green Arrow was similarly kept in the dark, though one wonders how he couldn't have noticed the difference between the two bodies in more 'intimate' moments. Perhaps he didn't have time to notice before the Crisis hit a short time thereafter."
244,Hourman (01 - Rex Tyler),Rex Tyler ,244_20051219000522_char.jpg,,,"Hourman was, in his civilian life, a scientist named Rex Tyler. Growing up in upstate New York, young Rex found an affinity for chemistry, particularly biochemistry. Working his way through college, he landed a job researching vitamins and hormone supplements at Bannermain Chemical. A series of discoveries and accidents led him to the 'miraculous vitamin' or Miraclo. He found that concentrated doses of that 'vitamin' given to test mice raised their strength and vitality several times that of normal. Taking a dose, Rex found that his strength, vitality, and speed increased to that of super-human levels. However, the human body could only process the Miraclo for an hour at a time. After that, the subject was weakened and returned to human strength levels. |||| |||| Keeping the discovery of Miraclo a secret, Tyler decided that human trials would be limited to the only subject he could trust: himself. Feeling that the Miraclo-induced abilities should be used for good purposes, he decided to use the abilities to help those that needed it; in other words, he would become a superhero. His first mission came as a result of Tyler's placing an ad stating that 'The Man of The Hour' would help those that needed it. Tracking down one respondent to the ad, he aided a housewife whose husband was falling in with the wrong crowd, and stopped a robbery. Using a costume he found in an abandoned costume shop, he started to adventure as The Hour-Man (later dropping the hyphen). In November 1940, Hourman became one of the founding members of the first superhero team, the Justice Society of America. After leaving the JSA in mid-1941, Tyler became one of Uncle Sam's initial group of Freedom Fighters. He later became part of the wartime All-Star Squadron. |||| |||| Hourman would be one of many heroes whose popularity would begin to decline in the post-war years. Eventually, his adventures ended. However, with the resurgence of super-heroes in the mid-1950s and early 1960s, interest in the Golden Age heroes returned, and Hourman was soon appearing as a guest star in issues of Justice League of America. Like all the other Golden Agers, he was now considered an elder statesman of the super-hero set. |||| |||| Unlike some other Golden Age heroes, his character would continue to grow more and more complex. The idea that Miraclo was addictive, combined with the suggestion that Tyler himself was addicted to crime fighting, made Hourman one of the superhero world's first cautionary tales. Rex would continue to fight both of his addictions throughout the rest of his appearances. His character was seemingly killed off along with other Golden Age heroes fighting a time-traveling villain named Extant. He was recently rescued from that fate by the third Hourman who took his place in that battle. Rex now lives in semi-retirement with his wife Wendi."

In particular, Bloodwynd has the ability to speak with the dead, and return them to haunt those who wronged them in life. Wears the so-called 'Blood Gem', as well as other gems, on his costume.  It is known that the Blood Gem, at least, gives him additional—if unspecified—mystical powers.",,"Bloodwynd is the descendant of slaves formerly owned by a man named Jacob Whitney.  Whitney himself was killed when the slaves created a magical stone called the Blood Gem and used it to murder the slaveholder.  What they did not realize was that the Blood Gem was a gateway to another dimension, and a demon by the name of Rott took possession of the souls killed by the stone's powers. |||| |||| Rott actually pulled Bloodwynd into the gem and forced the Martian Manhunter to wear it and impersonate the necromancer.  Blue Beetle figured out the deception during the battle with Doomsday when Bloodwynd was hurled into a fire that incapacitated him despite the fact that the real Bloodwynd had no vulnerability to heat or flames."
381,Richard 'Rick' Jones (Marvel),,381_20070218083954_char.jpg,"No innate superhuman powers; briefly possessed powers similar to the Hulk, causing him to transform into a gamma-powered behemoth of great strength and limited intellect.",,"Rick Jones was a rebellious youth who one day ran away from a state institution for troubled teens. He drove to an army test site where experiments involving gamma bombs were being conducted. Dr. Bruce Banner, the designer of the gamma bombs, realized that the boy was on the testing field. He threw Rick to safety, absorbing the radiation himself. As a result of this, Banner transformed into the Hulk. Jones remained with the Hulk for some time, becoming a close friend. |||| |||| Rick was instrumental in the creation of the Avengers, as after the evil Loki took control of the Hulk, Rick was the person who sent out the radio call to assemble the heroes. |||| He later went on to become Captain America's sidekick. However, after some time Rick started to resent being on the side-lines, This was assuaged when he discovered a pair of alien bracelets that let him trade places with Captain Mar-vell, an imprisoned Kree warrior. |||| |||| After the death of Mar-vell, Jones returned to the side of the Hulk, and also briefly became an ally of the Galadorian spaceknight Rom. He later met and married Marlo Chandler. |||| |||| Jones later sacrificed himself to prevent the destruction of all reality, but was saved when he merged with the son of Mar-Vell, Genis-Vell. This created a new Captain Marvel."

605,Champion (Marvel),Tryco Slatterus ,605_20070125011702_char.jpg,"Tryco possesses the 'Power Primordial' like the other Elders, but he seems to have focused solely on his physical attributes. He is very strong (He has destroyed a planet with a single punch) and invulnerable. His abilities are further augmented by the Power Gem. Death has cursed Tryco as well as the other Elders with immortality.",,"Tryco Slatterus, formerly the Champion of the Universe, is one of the Elders of the Universe-individuals who are the sole survivors of their races, date to the earliest days of the cosmos, and have spent their lives dedicated to one focus, In the Champion's case, this focus was personal competition. Accompanied by fight promoters and trainers, for millennia the Champion traveled the cosmos and defeated the best fighters of each world in hand-to-hand combat, always stopping the battles short of death. Proja, his Promoter Supreme, preceded the Champion of Earth and recruited eight of Earth's strongest male heroes (Champion having decided eons earlier that females were inferior and not worth fighting). Champion then forced their participation by threatening to destroy the planet should they not fight him-those unworthy of the glorious gift that is the true spirit of competition would be 'purified'. The eight combatants accompanied Champion to his extra dimensional training facility, but only six ultimately fought him in a force-field protected Madison Square Garden: Thor, Hulk, Sasquatch, Colossus, Wonder Man, and the Thing. The Champion defeated or disqualified the first five within one round each, and then proceeded to brutalize the Thing, who refused to fall. Battered and bloodied, the Thing battled on for three rounds, until the Champion called the fight and claimed the victory. However, the Thing's persistence and refusal to accept defeat earned him the Champion's respect, and the Champion departed for his next bouts, telling the Thing that he would consider for him the supreme honor: a rematch. |||| |||| The Champion subsequently conspired with fellow Elders Astronomer, Collector, Contemplator (actually a Skrull imposter), Gardener, Grandmaster, Obliterator, Possessor, Runner, Trader and their ally Ego to vanquish the few beings older than them. The Elders claimed that their ultimate goal was to obliterate the entire universe, with themselves re-emerging in the new universe that would follow as the oldest beings in creation, each possessing as much power in that universe as Galactus currently did in theirs.. The Champion traveled to Earth to defeat the Silver Surfer, whom the elders saw as a threat, but the Surfer beat Champion by using the power cosmic instead of hand-to-hand combat. The Champion then claimed that he had come only to prevent the Surfer from interfering in a Skrull attempt at cosmic domination-the Skrulls had captured Galactus' then herald Nova (Frankie Raye) and were using her to blackmail Galactus into devouring worlds of their choice; access to this information allowed the Surfer to deduce a method to free himself from his imprisonment on Earth. Retrieved by his fellow Elders after this defeat, the Champion observed as the Grandmaster manipulated Earth's Avengers as part of a wager with Death, winning Death's permanent refusal of all the Elders into its realm as his prize. Champion then battled Mantis and the Surfer when they learned of and opposed the Elder's plans. |||| |||| The Champion soon traveled to Grinx and defeated the planet's ablest combatants, claiming as his prize their world-trophy, an Infinity Gem. The other Elders gathered the remaining Infinity Gems and created a solar system spanning Infinity matrix which allowed them to draw out the energy of its sun and six planets and use that to drain Galactus's life force. The Surfer and Nova interfered by exploding the system's sun, disrupting the Elder's scheme, and Galactus consumed Champion, Collector, Gardener, Grandmaster, and Runner. Unable to die, the Elders survived inside Galactus, weakening him from within. When the Astronomer, Trader and Possessor allied with the In-Betweener to attempt to retrieve the five trapped Elders, the foursome attacked and defeated Galactus. Wanting Galactus dead (as part of a struggle against his own superiors, Master Chaos and Lord Order), the In-Betweener betrayed the three free Elders, confining them to Oblivion (disguised as Death by the In-Betweener). However, the Silver Surfer, Nova, Mr. Fantastic, and the Invisible Woman opposed the In-Betweener, saved Galactus. And inadvertently allowed the Elders trapped within Galactus, including Champion, to escape. Now free, the Elders each claimed an Infinity Gem, with the Champion taking the Infinity Gem of Power. They observed the battle which ensued between the In-Betweener and Galactus, intervening to see the In-Betweener banished back to the care of his masters as punishment in his role in condemning their three fellow Elders. When Galactus proved victorious, the Elders fled before the specter of his anger after their earlier attempt to kill him. |||| |||| Believing the Gem to be dormant and not wanting to attract the notice of Galactus, Death or Eternity, the Champion returned to his competitions. The Mad Titan Thanos found Slatterus on Tamarata, where the suddenly bloodthirsty Champion was engaging in mass battles instead of one-on-one fights, leaving many opponents dead on the field. Thanos tricked Slatterus into destroying the planet, and then offered to teleport the marooned Champion to another world in exchange for the 'dormant' Power Gem, a bargain he gladly accepted. Quickly conquering the simple dwellers on this new planet, the Champion obtained the foremost mystical artifacts of that world (wristlets which were apparently adaptations of the Quantum Bands), and then exterminated the planet's population before departing in search of both the Power Gem and revenge against its 'thief'. Champion eventually located the mad Titan, but when Thanos dismissively teleported Slatterus to a lifeless world, the Champion destroyed it in anger. Through the machinations of Mephisto (who was manipulating the Silver Surfer), the Champion soon learned that Thanos no longer held the Power Gem, and it was now in the hands of Drax the Destroyer. Slatterus attempted to head for Earth to find Drax but was opposed by the Surfer; Mephisto transported Drax to the field of battle and the Champion was defeated by the Silver Surfer and the Gem-powered Drax. The Surfer claimed and then destroyed the Champion's wristlets once he was defeated. |||| |||| The Power Gem passed through a number of hands (and universes) before the Champion finally recovered it and resumed his practice of seeking opponents. He settled in on planet Skardon, a planet where leadership was determined in hand-to-hand combat, and quickly became the planet's ruler. He then began running the planet into the ground, spreading word that he'd make the Skard suffer until a worthy challenger to his rule arose. Adam Warlock, who had experienced psychological difficulties himself while wielding the vampiric Soul Gem (another of the Infinity Gems), learned of the Champion's instability and used his Soul Gem to defeat Champion, but Skardon law did not allow them to acknowledge the out-of-ring defeat. |||| |||| While the Skardons aided the Champion in restoring himself after the defeat. Warlock sought opponents to defeat him within the ring. The Champion defeated the Shi'ar Gladiator, the Silver Surfer, Beta Ray Bill, Drax the Destroyer, and Adam Warlock himself before the Magistrati (agents of the Living Tribunal's universal law) sent a court-appointed advocate, the She-Hulk, to Skardon to oppose Champion at the request of Warlock's companion, Pip the Troll. Skardon law required Champion to accept even the challenge of a 'lesser' female, and She-Hulk was losing badly to Champion when she asked for an appeal and was granted an extension. She trained for three months on the theory that her human form of Jennifer Walters was weak, and by increasing her human strength, she'd exponentially increase her strength as She-Hulk. She then returned and objected to the Champion's use of the Power Gem, an alien object which should not be permissible within the ring according to Skardon law. The Champion, already irritated over the lengthy delay, angrily conceded the point and fought She-Hulk without it, and the pair even extended a bitter wager: if the Champion lost, he'd never wear the Gem again, and if the She-Hulk lost, she'd bear the Champion children for him to raise as future combatants. However, the Champion had apparently become dependent upon the Gem; that the She-Hulk's newly acquired bulk led to a quick defeat for the former Champion, reputedly his first ever defeat within the ring. He took the name 'Fallen One' and chose to provide the new 'Champion of the Universe' with worthy competition (and perhaps a little punishment as well). |||| Seeking out Zoma, a Watcher wishing vengeance on the She-Hulk on behalf of a banished friend, the Fallen One learned from him of She-Hulk's most ardent foe, Titania (Mary 'Skeeter' MacPherren) and gifted her with the Power Gem he'd agreed to surrender. The Fallen One trained Titania for several weeks in the American southwest until his new pupil, fearing Slatterus might take back the gem, dropped a small butte on him, burying him."

3253,Captain Marvel (Marvel)(02 - Monica Rambeau),Monica. Rambeau ,3253_20060413204229_char.jpg,"Pulsar can transform herself into any form of energy within the electromagnetic spectrum. Among the many energy forms she has assumed are cosmic rays, gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, visible light, electricity, infrared radiation, microwaves, radio waves and neutrinos. She is invisible and intangible in many of her energy forms (the most frequent exception being visible light), and is capable of flight in all her energy forms (reaching velocities up to and including light speed). She also has the ability to project these energies from her body while she is in human form, usually in the form of energy blasts from her hands; a variation of this ability enables her to project light-based holographic illusions. When she encounters a new or unfamiliar energy, Pulsar can often duplicate it given enough time for analysis, such as when she replicated and drained the verdant will-powered energies of an extra-dimensional emerald gladiator. Pulsar tends to be physically insubstantial in her energy forms, though with concentration and effort she can sometimes perform tasks such as briefly grasping an object, either by partially solidifying or by applying some sort of force to the object in question.",,"Monica Rambeau has always been devoted to serving and protecting the public, both as herself and in her various costumed guises. Before she became one of the brightest stars in the age of marvels, Monica Rambeau was a dedicated lieutenant in the New Orleans harbor patrol, partnered with the daring John Audain. Monica's life changed when old Rambeau family friend Professor Andre LeClare came to her for help; he had developed an other-dimensional energy-tapping device with financial support from South American dictator Ernesto Ramirez, who intended to use LeClare's technology to create incredibly dangerous weapons. Ramirez had already begun adapting the technology for his own purposes with the aid of scientist Felipe Picaro, but LeClare and Rambeau joined forces to destroy Picaro's prototype. In the process, Rambeau was bombarded by the device's extra-dimensional energies and gained the power to convert her own body into energy and back again at will. LeClare urged her to use this power as a crimefighter, and she left the harbor patrol to become a full-time adventurer. |||| |||| Dubbed Captain Marvel by the media, Rambeau sought out the Avengers for help in mastering her new powers and became a member-in-training of their group. Befriended and mentored by Avengers veterans Captain America and the Wasp, Monica soon graduated to full membership, serving a lengthy stint during which she became one of the team's most valuable and respected members. One early complication was the memory of an earlier Captain Marvel, the legendary alien warrior Mar-Vell, a deceased honorary member of the Avengers. Rambeau felt awkward about inheriting his title after she learned of his existence, but she retained the name since the Avengers and others regarded her as a worthy heir to Mar-Vell's heroic legacy. Another new Avengers recruit, Mar-Vell's close friend Starfox (Eros), disapproved of Monica using the Captain Marvel name at first; but even he was soon impressed by Monica's character and ability, giving her his blessing and saluting the new Captain Marvel. |||| |||| As an Avenger, Monica faced foes such as Maximus, the Enclave, Annihilus, the Lava Men (who mistook her for the divine Lady-of-Light of their legends), Morgan Le Fay, the Dire Wraiths, Maelstrom, the Skrulls, Kang, Attuma, Freedom Force, an insane Quicksilver, Tyrak, and Grandmaster's Legion of the Unliving, even battling an army of Earth's major super-criminals during the Beyonder's Secret Wars alongside many of Earth's foremost heroes. Two of Monica's earliest recurring enemies were super-powered psychiatrist Moonstone (Karla Sofen), who became one of Monica's bitterest foes, and Moonstone's powerful pawn Blackout (Marcus Daniels), who wielded the eerie Darkforce. Captain Marvel first encountered them when the Avengers opposed the duo's escape from incarceration in Project: PEGASUS. The pair would later return as members of Baron (Helmut) Zemo's Masters of Evil, participating in an occupation of Avengers Mansion and trapping Monica in the Darkforce dimension; but Captain Marvel escaped in time to help retake the Mansion during a series of skirmishes that left Moonstone temporarily crippled and Blackout dead. Another of Monica's major early foes was the murderous interstellar pirate Nebula, who shanghaied Monica into space for an extended period before she was reunited with the Avengers; but while Monica's adventures spanned space and time, she remained one of the most down-to-Earth Avengers. Her powers allowed her to make frequent visits to her native New Orleans, where she maintained a close and loving relationship with her parents. She even started a charter fishing business, eventually working on the water alongside her father, a retired firefighter and Monica's original heroic inspiration. |||| |||| When an exhausted Wasp stepped down as Avengers chairwoman, Captain America nominated Captain Marvel to replace her as team leader. Though she was overwhelmed at the prospect, Monica accepted the post and filled it quite capably at first, even seeing the team through a conflict with the Olympian gods; however, Monica became increasingly uneasy in her new role, a situation made worse after ambitious new recruit Doctor Druid began undermining her leadership. Finally, when honorary Avengers member Marrina transformed into the gigantic sea monster Leviathan, Captain Marvel led the hunt for the creature; during the battle that followed, Monica made contact with sea water while in her electrical form and accidentally conducted herself across the surface of the ocean, depleting her energies so gravely and dispersing her atoms so widely that she could barely regain physical form, emerging as a frail, withered husk of a woman devoid of super-powers. Forced to retire from the team, Monica fought her way back to health and eventually regained her powers, though in a reduced and altered form that allowed her to surround herself with a manipulable energy field. She resumed crimefighting, facing foes such as Brazilian crimelord Kristina Ramos, Moonstone, Powderkeg, the Sons of the Serpent, the Blue Marvel and the alien Starblasters. At the same time, she served as a cargo ship captain in her friend Ron Morgan's shipping company before starting her own charter business. Her original powers gradually regenerated, fully returning after the alien Stranger helpfully accelerated the process. |||| |||| Monica has yet to return to the full-time Avengers roster, but has stayed connected with the team and served often as a reservist, sometimes assuming leadership duties in the absence of the current chair. She helped repel an Atlantean invasion, opposed the Acts of Vengeance conspiracy, chaired a reserve substitute roster during the team's first United Nations-backed reorganization, led an Avengers delegation to the Shi'ar empire during the Kree-Shi'ar war, played a key role in overthrowing the alternate reality tyranny of Morgan le Fay (Monica being one of only a few heroes whose sense of Avengers spirit was strong enough to overcome Morgan's mind-warping magic), battled the Wrecking Crew, advised troubled new recruit Triathlon, led an ad hoc squad of Avengers in saving the galaxy from relocation by the Infinites, helped contain Bloodwraith, fought Lord Templar & Pagan, faced the Triple-Evil, helped liberate Earth from the forces of Kang, battled The Order, assisted during the Scorpio crisis, and was one of many Avengers who confronted an insane Scarlet Witch. Rambeau also helped staff the Avengers' deep space monitoring station in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, being one of the few Avengers who could commute there with ease. For a time, Monica's mother was intercepting her Avengers calls since she feared for her daughter's safety and wanted Monica to spend more time with her ailing father, but Monica soon put a stop to her mother's meddling. Whether she will work with the newly reorganized Avengers at some point remains to be seen. |||| |||| When the late Mar-Vell's offspring Genis became an adventurer, he soon became known as Captain Marvel like his father before him-which Monica resented at first. After she and Genis teamed up to defeat the Controller, Genis tried to concede the Captain Marvel title to Monica since he felt she was more worthy of it; but Monica declined out of respect for the Mar-Vell legacy, impulsively adopting a new costumed alias as Photon. More recently, Genis-physically and mentally transformed after a near-death experience and wanting to establish a new identity for himself distinct from his father-started calling himself Photon. Monica confronted him, tensely at first, but the two Photons ended up brainstorming super-hero names over coffee. Neither one of them wanted to become Captain Marvel again given all the baggage associated with the name, but Monica decided to let Genis keep the Photon alias after she came up with a name she liked better: Pulsar. A hero by any name, Monica remains one of the most formidable adventurers of her generation. |||| |||| Recently Monica has taken up the leadership mantle of the rogue superhero squad Nextwave and played a stellar role in helping Black Panther, Luke Cage, Blade, and Brother Voodoo rid her native New Orleans of an infestation of vampires."

(This was also were he loved and lost, for the first time, Elektra Natchios) Before Matt finished his degree, his father was killed by the command of a man known as The Fixer for refusing to throw a fight. This unfortunate event was the turning point in Matt's life and caused him to split his life in two. During the day, he is a crime fighter in the courts, but at night, he is a crime fighter on the streets of Hell's Kitchen. Founding a law firm with Foggy, Matt continued as both a lawyer and the vigilante Daredevil. Matt has been involved with a number of women, including Elektra Natchios, Natashia Romanov (Black Widow), Maya Lopez (Echo, Ronin), and one of the most important women in Matt's life, the late Karen Paige. Currently, Matt is involved with Milla Donovan who he has married. Recently, Daredevil's secret identity has been exposed by the tabloids and Matt was arrested for his vigilante efforts. He was moved to Rikers Island Penitentiary awaiting trial for vigilante acts committed as Daredevil. With the aid of Frank Castle (The Punisher) Matt escaped Rikers. Through the machinations of Vanessa Fisk, Matt has been exonerated and is reopening his law practice. |||| |||| He decided to stop wearing his mask and costume and embrace the fact that everyone knows he's Daredevil in Daredevil (2014) #14"

1481,Jonathan Joseph 'Pa' Kent (DC)(02 - post-Crisis),,1481_20070227022635_char.jpg,,,"With the John Byrne Man of Steel miniseries in 1986, both elder Kents were de-aged by a decade or so, and kept alive deep into his career as Superman.  Much of the mentoring we saw Jonathan Kent (02) give to Superboy are, in current continuity,  lessons given from a mid 50s Jonathan to an adult Clark.  He's been given further definition in the current version by his contrast with Martha, who tends to be portrayed as a more modern, more free-thinking woman, with echoes of Lois and/or Chloe Sullivan. For maybe the first time since the character's original inception in 1939, he also has a role to play with other players in the broader DCU--not only (Kon-El) Superboy and both 21st century versions of Supergirl, but also some members of the Justice League.  Perhaps more so than his wife, Martha Kent (II), there is a very close relationship between his persona in comics and that of the actor playing him on the television series, Smallville .  It is unclear which way the causal arrow is pointing on this phenomenon though.  Is actor John Schneider secretly reading current comics for cues?  Are the Smallville writers, led by influential Superman writer, Jeph Loeb, simply giving Schneider scripts which offer a more direct translation of his comics counterpart?  Or are Superman writers and artists fans of Schneider's work and 'look'?  Whatever the case, the similarities between Smallville 's Jonathan Kent and DC's 'Jonathan Kent' have been increasingly close for the first half of the first decade of the 21st century."

253,Blue Beetle (DC)(02 - Ted Kord),Theodore Stephen 'Ted' Kord ,253_20110814080320_char.jpg,,,"Originally created by Steve Ditko for Charlton, this is the Blue Beetle active between Crisis on Infinite Earths and Infinite Crisis .  He passed into the DCU following Charlton's sale to DC, and was an important part of the two Crises .  Undoubtedly, though, he will always be remembered for his greater role in the run-up to Infinite Crisis . Unlike the previous Blue Beetle, Dan Garrett, Ted was really not much more than a well-trained athlete, though he did have an exceptional mind.  He was, thus, a somewhat redundant character in the DCU, given the greater prominence of the similar Batman and Mr. Terrific.  His distinction was that he was possessed of a much lighter personality than these DC-created characters, and so tended to attract a unique following of his own, despite the sameness of his 'powers'.   He was a more realistic version of the character archetype, struggling with weight gain as he got older, and poking fun at his own lack of super powers when in the company of 'greater' heroes like Superman. He and Booster Gold formed an alliance while in JLA service that was used, with varying degrees of fan reception,  to illustrate what the JLA was like to those who were a little lower on the roster than Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and the Flash. DC, new outright owner of both Blue Beetle II and Blue Beetle III, would eventually show that there was a relationship between the two men.  Ted was shown to be a student of the archaeologist Dan Garrett.  When a crisis struck, caused by Ted's uncle and his army of androids, Ted and Dan went to battle against them.  Dan was killed by the threat, but, ostensibly impressed by Ted's willingness to do what was right even against the wishes of a close family member, Dan entrusted Ted with the legacy of the Blue Beetle.  Unfortunately, Garrett was unable to pass his empowering scarab onto Ted, so Kord was forced to find another way to uphold the mantle. |||| |||| Eventually, though, Kord did come into possession of the scarab, but the wizard Shazam took it from him in the 80-page story, Countdown to Infinite Crisis , just prior to Kord's now-famous death at the hands of Maxwell Lord. |||| |||| When Shazam himself was killed by The Spectre in Day of Vengeance many of his 'mystical trinkets' were shown to be scattered in the 'real' plane of existence.  The Garrett/Kord scarab landed in El Paso, Texas, opening the door for a future Blue Beetle IV."
7472,The Captain (Marvel)(01 - Steve Rogers),Steve Rogers. ,7472_20080914132750_char.jpg,,,"Taking place over Captain America issues 332 to 350 'Cap No More' involves the US Government finding out the secret identity of Captain America and declaring his costume and shield as Gov. property. |||| |||| Writer Mark Gruenwald has been in the comic business for over 20 years and his greatest is his run on the Marvel 'Captain America' comics. Gruenwald defined the personality of Captain America starting with issue 273 until issue 442 (Captain America's last issue was 452). One of the most memorable Gruenwald storylines was 'Cap No More' (Issue 332 till 350) wherein the US Government discovers the secret identity of Captain America and subsequently declare the costume, shield, and very symbol that is Captain America as government property. In order to retain the persona of Captain America, Steve Rogers was ordered to serve as a government agent answering only to the Higher Commission, a group of suits in charge of super human activities. |||| |||| With the United States being a free country, Rogers envoked his right to choose and after 24 hours gave up the uniform and shield of Captain America. After several weeks, Rogers emerged as 'The Captain' (US Agent's costume for those of you who are unfamiliar with 'The Captain') and armed with a Vibranium shield provided by Stark Enterprises, The Captain went after a number of villains like the Serpent Society, Famine of the Four Horsemen of Apocalypes, Crossbones, The Red Skull, etc. The Captain was not alone in his crusade as his comrades: The Falcon, Nomad, Vagabond, and 'D-Man' Demolition Man weren't that far behind. This particular storyline concludes in issue 350 wherein the clone of Steve Rogers who was actually the Red Skull pitted Johnny Walker, The New Captain America against the old Captain America, Steve Rogers 'The Captain.' |||| |||| Both Rogers and Walker were able to work together to defeat the Red Skull and the Commission, deemed Walker to be too volatile as Captain America and gave the role as well as all the rights and privileges back to Rogers who resumed his role as the original Captain America. Not long after, the Commission orchestrated a mock assassination on Walker and bought the rights to Roger's 'The Captain' costume and subsequently gave it to Walker who underwent speech and movement therapy to change his voice as well as his mannerisms."

1767,Taskmaster (Marvel),Tony Masters ,1767_20060523110651_char.jpg,"Taskmaster has photographic reflexes. By watching an action, he can execute that action perfectly. He can also, after much practice, mimic voices.",,"The man who would become the Taskmaster first demonstrated unusual abilities during childhood. After watching a cowboy show on television, he found himself able to duplicate the sophisticated rope tricks he had just watched the cowboy perform. Psychiatrists, called in at the mother's request, termed the boy's rare ability 'Photographic Reflexes'. He realized the limitations of his abilities the hard way by learning you must first learn how to swim before you learn how to dive as he nearly drowned. He employed his talent several times during his youth for professional gain, most notably when he became a star quarterback of his high school football team after watching one pro football game. Upon graduation, he briefly considered a career as a crime fighter, but opted for becoming a criminal, which he perceived to be more lucrative. |||| |||| Taskmaster then began a program of observing the fighting techniques of a large number of superhumanly powered adventurers through archival television news broadcasts. He initially used his fighting skills to execute several successful grand larcenies, but he had not properly anticipated the dangers involved. He decided to use his stolen capital to establish a center for training aspiring criminals to become polished professionals. His goal was to become a supplier for criminal organizations around the world. Designing a costume, he took the name Taskmaster and began to train a large number of thugs at this criminal academy located near the town of Southampton on New York State's Long Island. |||| |||| It didn't take long for Taskmaster to get noticed by the criminal community and he was soon hired by the international terrorist organization known as Hydra to train Spider-Woman, who had become Hydra's latest operative. Taskmaster began to test Spider-Woman's powers and abilities until he thought she was ready to begin her true training in advanced martial arts to become a perfect weapon for Hydra. The training continued until Spider-Woman believed she was ready to be sent on assignment. |||| |||| When Spider-Woman failed her mission to kill Nick Fury and learned the truth about Hydra, she fled into hiding. Once Hydra was able to track her down, they sent Taskmaster in to bring her back. Underestimating her skills, Spider-Woman was able to defeat Taskmaster by stabbing him with a sword and using him as a conductor to channel her powers through to effect all Hydra agents surrounding them. |||| |||| This crime college was forced to cease operations when its front organization, the Solomon Institute for the Criminally Insane, was exposed by the Avengers. Taskmaster's chief business administrator, Dr. Pernell Solomon, afflicted with a serious heart condition, had forced the academies scientific staff to generate a clone of himself, with the purpose of using its heart for a compatible transplant. The clone, artificially aged to adulthood, escaped and alerted the Avengers to the existence of the criminal institute. Although the Avengers apprehended most of the Solomon Institute's personnel, Taskmaster managed to escape. |||| |||| Taskmaster established a new academy in a warehouse on Manhattan's lower west side, but the crime fighters Spider-Man and Ant-Man, following separate leads, discovered the place and thwarted Taskmaster's plan to rob nuclear material from a scientific supply house. Taskmaster was again forced to flee, claiming to have established technical institutes for criminals across the country. |||| |||| Taskmaster went into hiding and continued to train various recruits. During this time he trained and recruited Brock Rumlow and Blanche Sitznski to be instructors at one of his warehouse academies in Pennsylvania. Shortly afterwards Rachel Leighton and Sheoke Sanada would become members of Taskmaster's recruits to receive training at this location. |||| |||| Taskmaster was next observed at the Carson Carnival of Traveling Wonders, a small company that happened to have given Hawkeye his first job as an archer as a youth. Taskmaster was using the carnival as a traveling front for his operations until Hawkeye and Ant-Man (Scott Lang) compromised it. Again, the Taskmaster managed to escape custody. |||| |||| Taskmaster would later be hired by Black Abbott to recruit a group of street gangs from various neighborhoods together to train at one of his academies. This gathering would be interrupted by Spider-Man and Nomad. Already paid in full for recruiting the group, Taskmaster would soon flee instead of taking the chance at being captured. |||| |||| Taskmaster teamed up with Wizard, Constrictor and Deadpool to become the newest version of the Frightful Four. The Frightful Four attacked the Fantastic Four at their home located in the Baxter Building. The Thing and Franklin Richards where the only members there at the time. The Frightful Four captured the Thing, but Franklin Richards proved to be more trouble than planned. The Fantastic Four soon arrived home and Taskmaster, Wizard, and Constrictor would leave Deadpool behind to face the rest of the team alone. |||| |||| Deciding to further explore the use of a circus as a front for his academy, Taskmaster took over yet another small outfit, and used it for many months to great success. However, while it was playing a small town in Ohio, the Thing and Vance Astrovik assisted a government agent in foiling Taskmaster's activities. While escaping the Taskmaster was captured by a group of FBI agents and taken into custody, but there is reason to believe that the Red Skull was behind the Taskmaster's capture since a group of normal men were able to capture him. |||| |||| Sometime later, Justin Hammer hired Taskmaster to train a new Spymaster Taskmaster gathered a small group of his best students and put them through a rigorous program of training including a dangerous course as well against themselves until only one remained alive. The student known only as 'Number One' survived and deemed worthy of the name 'Spymaster'. Taskmaster charged the new Spymaster to retrieve the golden angel ornament from atop of the Christmas tree at Stark Enterprises as a field test in order to graduate before sending him to Justin Hammer. Iron Man decided to let Spymaster walk away with the prize instead of endangering the lives of children in the area. |||| |||| Taskmaster didn't take it too kindly when a student of his named Tyrone McQuaid decided to quit. Taskmaster sent other students of his out to kill him. Not knowing where to turn, Tyrone went to the local social services office in Harlem to find the Falcon. Tyrone told the Falcon the location of Taskmaster's academy where he was trained. The confrontation between Taskmaster and the Falcon didn't last long due to the interference of Tyrone and the Police. Taskmaster once again escaped capture. |||| |||| Through Douglas Rockwell, the head of the President's Commission on Superhuman Activities, Red Skull, who used the identity “Mr. Smith“, arranged for the Taskmaster to train John Walker to become the next Captain America in order to disgrace the image of Captain America. In order to conceal the Red Skull's involvement, Douglas Rockwell had the Commission work out a deal to have years taken off Taskmaster's sentence for training Walker. After Taskmaster successfully trained Walker to be the next Captain America for the Commission, the Red Skull had it arranged for the Taskmaster to escape from the Commission's detention center so he could continue training lackeys for the Red Skull. |||| |||| Taskmaster would next set up a new academy at an unknown graveyard mausoleum in Brooklyn, New York. Spider-Man believed Taskmaster to be responsible for kidnapping his wife Mary Jane and interrupted Taskmaster's plans while searching for her. Using his magnesium flare, Taskmaster managed to escape Spider-Man's wrath as well as capture. |||| |||| Shortly after Taskmaster’s arranged escape, the Red Skull (Johann Schmidt) hired Taskmaster to train sparring partners for him in order to get his newly cloned body of Captain America in physical fighting shape for a confrontation with The Captain (Captain America, Steve Rogers) and Captain America (U.S. Agent, John Walker). It is also possible that Taskmaster even trained the Red Skull himself. |||| |||| A faction group of the Hand hired Taskmaster and Tombstone to kill numerous people for them. The Hand created a contest between the two as to who could kill the most according to rules set by the Hand. This lead to a confrontation with both Daredevil and the Punisher as well as between the two. Taskmaster was hit by a car during the battle between all four men. Punisher then tried attempted to throw a knife at Taskmaster's heart. Daredevil deflected the knife by shooting it using a gun and instead caused it to stab Taskmaster in the ribs. Taskmaster would be taken to the hospital by the paramedics. Daredevil would later pay Taskmaster a visit at the hospital as Matt Murdock to get information about the contest. Taskmaster asked if he was Daredevil and Matt Murdock replied indicating that Taskmaster was correct in knowing his secret identity. Taskmaster's face would be seen for the first time, but it is unknown if this was Taskmaster's true face or not and believed to be a holographic image. |||| |||| Taskmaster would next be seen as one of the Red Skull's (Johann Schmidt) Division Chiefs. The other Division Chiefs consisted of Watchdog Prime (Watchdogs), a Scourge, Crucible of the Resistants, Sin, Power Broker, Number Seven of the Secret Empire, Arnim Zola, Baron Von Strucker and Minister Blood. |||| |||| The Red Skull (Johann Schmidt) had Mother Night search for a replacement for Crossbones when he took a leave of absence from the Skeleton Crew. She found Cutthroat to be the best candidate for a replacement. In order to look good for the Red Skull, Mother Night told Taskmaster that the Red Skull himself put in a special request for a private training. |||| |||| Spider-Man's (Peter Parker) path crossed with the Red Skull (Johann Schmidt) when he was searching for answers about his parents. The Red Skull contacted Taskmaster to take care of Spider-Man for him. Taskmaster seen this as an opportunity to try out new recruits he had trained to be versions of Captain America, Hawkeye, and Spider-Man himself. The anti-terrorist known as Solo was also searching for the Red Skull at the time. Spider-Man and Solo decided to team up together to find the Red Skull. Blood Spider, Deathshield and Jagged Bow were defeated due to Solo's interference. Taskmaster fled once again escaping capture. Taskmaster contacted the Red Skull afterwards to inform him of his failure to stop Spider-Man. The Red Skull told Taskmaster that he expected him to make up for it in full. |||| |||| The Chess Set contacted Taskmaster and other villains in order to sell energy saturated corpses of Silver, Auric and Hedison. This lead to a confrontation with Alpha Flight, Spider-Man and Wolverine. |||| |||| Taskmaster overheard discussion about restaurant grease worth half a million dollars while walking through the New York fair. Taskmaster decided to go after the grease only to find others after it as well. This lead to a confrontation with Daredevil, Stilt-Man, Tatterdemalion and Wild Boys. Taskmaster was unable to escape capture this time as the police arrested him along with the rest of the villains. |||| |||| When the Trapster took the Tinkerer to court for consumer fraud, Taskmaster was called as a witness on behalf of the Tinkerer. A fight erupted during the trial causing many super-villains to be captured, but Taskmaster once again escaped. |||| |||| After the Avengers and Ultraforce defeated Nemesis, Siren was transported into one of Taskmaster's academies. Taskmaster auditioned Siren for his school soon afterwards. When Diamondback appeared during the audition the two of them began to fight to prove themselves worthy to Taskmaster. Taskmaster informed them that he had a job for the both of them and assigned the two of them to kill the former Avenger War Machine, knowing that they would be unable to complete the mission. Taskmaster hid the true task from the two of them, which was that Taskmaster was hired by an unknown person to gather information on War Machine. Unknown to Siren and Diamondback, Taskmaster placed a device to record information on War Machine's new armor. Taskmaster misinformed the two of them that the mission was to kill War Machine so the two of them would test the armor in order to record the needed information. During Diamondback and Siren's mission a young boy by the name of Kyi stowed away on the quinjet in hopes of becoming one of Taskmaster's students. Taskmaster refused to allow a child into his academy until he found out that Kyi had potential and power of teleportation. Kyi would eventually take the name Jolt due to his powers. |||| |||| Taskmaster began to develop a relationship with Siren. Taskmaster soon found out that Diamondback double crossed him by planting explosive devices around his headquarters. Jolt accidentally started one of the devices when he removed one of the diamonds attached. Taskmaster had Jolt open a teleportation hole large enough for Siren, Jolt and himself to escape the explosion. During the journey through the portal Siren was sent back to her own dimension while Taskmaster and Jolt teleported to an unknown location. |||| |||| When a being from another universe entered the Earth-616 universe to learn how the universe was created, he met the Elders of the Universe known as Grandmaster. This universal traveler explained to Grandmaster that he planned on learning from this universe or would destroy it. Grandmaster talked the traveler into playing a cosmic chess game using the inhabitants of each other’s universe as their pawns. However, the traveler instead attempted to merge two cosmic universe together and enlisted the aid of many foes of both the Avengers and the other universe’s champions by mentally enthralling them to help his plans of universal domination. Taskmaster teamed with Shockwave, Whiplash, Crossbones, Zaran the Weapons Master, Tumbler, Razor-Fist, Machete, Conquest and a martial arts expert from the other universe to fight Black Widow, Black Panther and two caped urban knights from the other universe. It is unknown how long the battle took place, but it ended with Taskmaster’s team defeated. Once the Avengers and the other universe’s champions defeated the traveler, both universes and their inhabitants were returned to their rightful place in their respective universe. |||| |||| When the Avengers began to change their tactics to a more proactive stage and kept themselves updated on all major dangers at large to become more effective. They started by searching for Taskmaster in order to put a stop to his operations and denying criminals, terrorists and super-villains a valuable resource. However, Taskmaster continued to elude them with each academy they shut down. |||| |||| Due to the Avengers shutting down a vast majority of his academies, Taskmaster decided to make up his lost profit’s with more lucrative jobs and doing work-for-hire. One of his first job was to help out his old friend Jonesy in Las Vegas by stopping a small-time hustler that has been pulling a big-time scam at his casino. It took only three winning hands for Taskmaster to figure out the scam. On his way out of the casino Taskmaster met a woman by the name of Sandi Brandenberg, whom he decided to take a chance with and asked her out to dinner. |||| |||| The next day Taskmaster was hired by Sunset Bain to sabotage Stark Enterprises’ research and technology in developing a new semiconductor and put a stop to the Chinese Triads’ plan to steal the same technology. Taskmaster succeeded with the industrial sabotage of Stark Labs, but was confronted by Iron Man in the process. Knowing that he could not defeat Iron Man in hand-to-hand combat, he used his skills to evade and keep him off balanced enough to escape. When he went to claim his payment, he found himself set up by Sunset Bain. |||| |||| Sunset Bain’s betrayal did not go over too well with Taskmaster and he began planning payback. Using his skills he set Bain and the Chinese Triads against one another, making them believe each other had betrayed the other. However the Triad found out that it was Taskmaster that killed one of their members and not Sunset Bain. Sunset Bain and the Triad called a truce and allied with each other. The Triad’s first gesture of good faith offered to capture Taskmaster for Sunset Bain. The Triad managed to catch Taskmaster off guard and interrupted a date with Sandi. The Triad managed to capture Taskmaster and brought him to Sunset Bain only to be betrayed by her and killed by her men. Sunset Bain had her men torture Taskmaster within an inch of his life, stuffed into a weighted body bag and thrown off a bridge into a river. Using the skills he discovered while at a Buddhist school in Tibet, Taskmaster used meditation techniques to slow his breath and heart rate down, which allowed him to survive underwater for an extended period of time without oxygen, Taskmaster escaped and made his way to the surface. Knowing that he would need more experience in order to take on Sunset Bain’s entire group of henchmen, he began to watch kung-fu movies fast forwarded in order to move at a faster speed than normal. Using his new skills, Taskmaster stormed Sunset Bain’s New York office and easily made his way to a face to face confrontation with Sunset herself after defeating Sunset’s personal bodyguard Mr. Isley. Taskmaster was interrupted by a helicopter outside Sunset’s window before he could deliver a killing blow. While on his way out of her office he reminded Sunset that his vendetta against her wasn’t over. |||| |||| When the Superhuman Registration Act went into effect, Taskmaster reluctantly decided to help the government. Soon after, the Committee contracted Taskmaster to kill Moon Knight. The Profile told Taskmaster that Moon Knight would be friendless, alone, with no fight left in him and ready to die. Expecting this to be easy money, Taskmaster accepted the contract while also contacting the CSA about Moon Knight returning to being a costumed vigilante again. Unfortunately for Taskmaster, everything the Profile had told him was incorrect. While Mark Spector was indeed ready to die at one point, he received a sudden urge to continue living after one of his closest friends was nearly beaten to death. This lead to a short fight with Mark Spector and his friends, which resulted in Taskmaster being shot in the chest with a musket gun and falling out of a window. Upset over the fact that he was lied to, Taskmaster confronted the Committee demanding compensation for lost equipment and time. During this confrontation, Mark Spector flew his Mooncopter into the building, seeking vengeance. |||| |||| It is unknown how or when, but at some point Taskmaster was once again captured and like last time, was offered a deal to work off his sentence. Under the Fifty State Initiative, he joined the Thunderbolts who were now a group of villains working for the CSA in a work release program. Their assignment is to capture both renegade heroes and villains that have not registered. Not taking any chances, Mister Fantastic chipped and tagged each member with nanobot technology to monitor their actions. |||| Due to recent events, it is unknown if Taskmaster continues to train criminals at various academies across the United States. However as history has shown, once he is free again, he will continue his training of others so that he does not have to get personally involved in battle in order to make a profit."

645,Wrecker (Marvel)(03 - Dirk Garthwaite),Dirk Garthwaite ,645_20070907015840_char.jpg,"Having been transformed by Asgardian magic, the Wrecker originally possessed power that made him the equivalent of an Asgardian god—vast superhuman strength and a high degree of invulnerability with some resistance to cold, heat, fire, corrosives and toxins. He later shared this enchantment with three others, sacrificing some of his own power but remaining none the less formidable.",,"Burt Garthwaite, construction worker and abusive father and husband, left his family when his son Dirk was at an early age (although his mother believed him to have later died and led her son to believe so as well). Dirk grew up filled with resentment and anger, becoming a laborer for a demolitions company, but he was fired for his disruptive and violent behavior. Turning to crime, he used a crowbar as a reminder of this father, destroying each place he robbed. Called the Wrecker, he managed to continually elude the police. |||| |||| One day, the Wrecker happened to attempt a robbery at a hotel room used by Loki, who was then stripped of his magical powers. Loki had just requested mystical enhancements from Karnilla the Norn Queen to oppose Thor. Karnilla cast the spell upon Dirk instead, since he was playfully trying on Loki’s hat. Flushed with his new superhuman power, he began a rampage in the city but was confronted by Thor. The battle raged for hours, but the Wrecker was eventually stopped by the Destroyer automaton, animated by the spirit of Sif. He was kept imprisoned under heavy sedation, but he eventually overcame the sedation to seek revenge. This time, Thor proved more than a match. The Wrecker was thrown against the third rail of a subway track, and Thor’s hammer was able to draw the Wrecker’s power away. |||| |||| While in prison, Dirk kept tabs on the location of his crowbar. With his fellow convicts Dr. Eliot Franklin, Brian Calusky and Henry Camp, he managed to break out and retrieve the crowbar. Correctly assuming the crowbar housed the powers that had been drained from him, the Wrecker had his three friends grasp the bar with him in an electrical storm, and the storm transferred the power amongst the four of them. Franklin became Thunderball; Calusky became Piledriver; and Camp became Bulldozer. Together, they became known as the Wrecking Crew. |||| |||| After their first foray against the Defenders, the Wrecker and the Wrecking Crew were inseparable, including their abduction to Battleworld by the Beyonder and joining with Doctor Doom's army of super-villains. The Crew also joined Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil and the Wrecker was instrumental in helping bring down Hercules. After this, Thor used his hammer to draw the Wrecker’s away from the others who divided it, and the all-powerful Wrecker was brought down by Captain America. |||| |||| When Spider-Woman was on the trail of the Wrecker at large, Spider-Man also appeared to help. The heroes learned that nearly all of the Wrecker’s crimes were meant to fund his mother’s medical expenses, as she had laid bed-ridden for many years. Spider-Woman visited her, and she revealed that she never took his money, knowing where it came from and how he came about it. She interrupted Spider-Man and the Wrecker’s fight to show him a letter she had written moments before passing away, He read it and then left, distraught. |||| |||| Months later, the Wrecker freed his Crew, and they performed many other acts of villainy, although they had to deal often with the treachery of Thunderball, who craved the Wrecker’s power all for himself. Eventually, the Crew reconciled, seeking out Hercules once more. But battling them helped Hercules overcome the fear of combat he had suffered since the beating at their hands, and they were defeated. Ultimately, Loki decided that he wanted the power of the Wrecker for himself, since it had been meant for him, and while the Crew were battling Thor and the Ghost Rider, he had the Enchantress and Ulik bring down each member of the Crew, until only the Wrecker remained. Loki proceeded to torture the Wrecker, and finally cast him into another dimension. |||| |||| The Wrecker found out how to appear on Earth during periods of concentration and sought out his long-lost father, Burt, who was discovered to be alive and living in a retirement home. Thunderstrike and Code: Blue managed to track the Wrecker and arranged a trap for him at his fathers’. During the encounter, Burt continued to browbeat his son and, suddenly, suffered a heart attack. The Wrecker was denied his change of revenge and snapped back to his exile. |||| |||| The Wrecker somehow finally returned to Earth and was reunited with the Crew, but their powers began fading when many of Asgard's links to Earth were separated. Leaving the Crew to find the source of his fading powers, he found the god Set, who beat him so severely as to remand him to the hospital. Later, the entire Crew received a power boost when hired by Arnim Zola to battle the Thunderbolts (unaware that the Thunderbolts included many of their former allies in the Masters of Evil). Although this power boost was successful, it was based on science, not magic, and the Wrecker came to believe later that he lost the “edge” Asgardian power gave him. |||| |||| Once again, the Wrecking Crew appeared as a whole in their subsequent endeavors, hired by the likes of the Doomsday Man, battling heroes such as the Avengers and the Warriors Three, used as lackeys by Morgan le Fay, among others. When the Crew was imprisoned in the Raft, they joined the massive breakout and escaped, but the Wrecker was apart from the Crew when he was recaptured by a new version of the Avengers."
155,Diablo (Marvel)(01 - Esteban de Ablo),Esteban Corazón De Ablo ,155_20070809000404_char.jpg,"Diablo possesses no super-human powers except for the prolonged life and vitality granted to him by an alchemical elixir which he must take from time to time. |||| |||| Diablo is an accomplished alchemist, and is able to use chemicals (often used as thrown pellets) to create many miraculous affects, such as invulnerable materials, fast-growing plants, paralysis gas, and much more.",,"Esteban Corazon de Ablo was a powerful alchemist in the 9th Century who sold his soul to the demon Mephisto to lengthen his life far beyond a human span. Years later, Diablo set up a base in Transylvania, but the villagers there turned against him and buried him within a stone crypt under his castle. Another century later, the Fantastic Four appeared in Transylvania on a vacation. A local, Baron Hugo, told them the legend of Diablo. That night, Diablo whispered to the Thing to awake and free him from his prison by pulling out the stone plug on his crypt and smashing the stone slab that covered him. Freed, Diablo offered a potion to the Thing that would turn him halfway into a human, and in exchange for Ben’s services for a year, he would give him the other potion that would finalize the change. |||| |||| |||| When the rest of the Fantastic Four arrived, they found Ben working for Diablo. They fought with him and tried to convince him to leave his service, but Ben refused, and the four were forced to leave him behind. Diablo soon made his appearance known to the world, and sold his alchemical chemicals internationally, making him the richest man on the planet. Shortly before the rest of the world, Mister Fantastic discovered that Diablo’s chemicals worked, but only for a short while before failing. The world turned on Diablo, but he had already built up an army of loyal followers and was prepared to use his alchemical powers to conquer the planet. |||| |||| |||| But once Diablo had revealed his true intentions, the Fantastic Four were free to attack him. At the same time, the Thing had also discovered that the potion he was given wore off, and he turned on Diablo, but Diablo used one of his chemical pellets to knock him out and seal him in an unbreakable, glass capsule. The remaining three members of the Fantastic Four soon attacked Diablo’s fortress, but after a struggle, Diablo managed to capture them with his chemical pellets. Diablo sealed up the last of the Fantastic Four in the same capsules, but Ben quickly escaped when his broke down. Angered, he chased Diablo through his own castle until he crushed a suit of armor into a giant ball and threw it after the alchemist. Diablo ran from it, hiding within the crypt that the villagers had sealed him in. The Thing followed behind him and reinserted the giant, stone plug, and then smashed it with both fists, causing the entire castle to come crumbling down upon the crypt. The Fantastic Four were later freed, and the Human Torch melted the stone into slag to harden Diablo’s prison. |||| |||| |||| But Diablo eventually used his potions to destroy his melted, stone prison, and escape to revenge himself upon the Fantastic Four. His next move was to travel to North America and New York's State University, where he helped Professor Gilbert to animate his android creation, Dragon Man. He turned the Dragon Man against the Fantastic Four, but it eventually turned on him and drove both of them underneath a frozen lake, where he was lost for a time. Diablo was also later responsible for the destruction of their pen-ultimate headquarters, Pier 4."
436,M.O.D.O.K. (Marvel),George Tarleton ,436_20061219122332_char.jpg,"Fantastic psionic abilities and superhuman calculating ability. Can form force field barriers effective against energy attacks, mentally produce heat and mental blasts of pure psionic energy, probe the minds of others, and recall any fact he has ever known. He can also convert himself into raw data and travel in the form of e-mail.",Love.,"Average technician George Tarleton found his fate forever changed thanks to a random selection by his boss, the Scientist Supreme of A.I.M., who needed a unique, bio-engineered 'living computer' in order to plumb the mysteries of the Cosmic Cube. Tarleton was subjected to hideous experiments, mutating his body into a massive-headed being possessing superhuman intelligence and extraordinary psionic powers, and the process drove him mad. Given the code-name MODOC ('Mobile Organism Designed Only for Computing'), Tarleton instead turned on his superiors, slaying them all and declaring himself Scientist Supreme. Moreover, he changed his name to MODOK, with the 'K'� standing now for 'Killing'.� |||| |||| Knowing only the barest of information, S.H.I.E.L.D. sent its Agent 13 to gather intelligence about A.I.M. and MODOK, but she was captured and Captain America was then sent to the rescue. The two heroes were captured, but ultimately discovered MODOK when he revealed himself and tried to kill them personally. During the resultant clash, other A.I.M. agents, those opposed to MODOK's leadership, turned on him and allowed Captain America and Agent 13 to escape. The submarine base destroyed, MODOK was believed dead, although he used his psionic abilities to save himself and soon reasserted his leadership over A.I.M. |||| |||| Initially, MODOK turned A.I.M.'s pursuits toward acquiring technology and new recruits, running into conflict with Captain America, Doctor Doom and the Sub-Mariner, and the Hulk. During the latter confrontation, MODOK first used a giant robot body in a preemptive strike on the Hulk, and later he mutated Betty Ross into the Harpy to defeat him (although MODOK was stopped by the arrival of the Bird People.) MODOK used his giant body to confront Iron Man, capturing him but being defeated by the Yellow Claw. |||| |||| Following this defeat, MODOK was deposed as leader of A.I.M., as his followers were dissatisfied with MODOK's increasing preoccupation with his super-powered adversaries causing A.I.M. to largely abandon its goals for scientific breakthroughs. However, MODOK regained control of a West Coast faction of A.I.M. and, in alliance with Deathbird, he led A.I.M. in an attack on its East Coast division. Still, a considerable portion of the A.I.M. organization remained outside of MODOK's control. MODOK did not realize that the members of A.I.M. whom he believed were securely under his control were secretly conspiring with the other faction of A.I.M. to destroy him. To his surprise, both A.I.M. groups joined forces and attacked him. MODOK retreated, soon afterward fighting A.I.M. forces alongside the Hulk, but he finally fled after battling the Hulk himself. With MODOK gone, all of A.I.M. was finally reunited under new leadership. |||| |||| The new leaders of A.I.M. hired the Serpent Society to assassinate MODOK to prevent him from posing any further threat to them. MODOK had escaped capture, ultimately hiding in a warehouse at a shopping mall in Newbury, New Jersey, but he was followed by both the Serpent Society and Captain America. Captain America found the weakened MODOK as two of the Serpents, Cottonmouth and Death Adder, were tearing away at his flesh. MODOK died even as Captain America was trying to help him, and the Serpents delivered his corpse back to A.I.M. |||| |||| A.I.M. managed to keep MODOK's body for use as a living computer, similar to his intended origin, but A.I.M. agent Yorgon Tykkio sent MODOK into battle against Iron Man, guiding him by remote control. At the height of battle, however, Tykkio caused MODOK's headband to fire plasma that ignited underground fuel lines, causing an explosion that ultimately annihilated MODOK's body. |||| |||| Years later, A.I.M. once again sought the control of the Cosmic Cube, and in so doing they tore reality itself. Using the Cube, they restored MODOK to life, hoping that he could command the energies to fix reality. Although it was actually an Adaptoid that saved the day, MODOK took advantage to resume leadership of A.I.M. once more. |||| |||| He returned to his preoccupation with his rivals, battling Captain America and Iron Man, but he also explored new avenues for A.I.M., such as exploring the relationship of science and magic (running afoul of Alpha Flight for reviving their member Snowbird), allying with Hydra over nanotechnology (before taken down by Citizen V and the V-Battalion), and creating a legitimate corporate front for A.I.M. as Advanced Corp. (until exposed by Iron Man.) MODOK was once saved by the Headmen from where he had lost himself in an extra-dimensional quest for additional power. In gratitude, he agreed to join them in their hopes of taking over the world, helping them do so with the help of the alien Orrgo. MODOK admitted, however, that this association was merely scientific, as he examined the efforts of the Headmen to better understand himself, and he and A.I.M. disassociated themselves from the Headmen before the villains were thwarted by the Defenders. |||| In a strange series of events, MODOK appeared to be hunting down and killing all A.I.M. agents responsible for his original transformation. In fact, MODOK had switched bodies with Damocles 'the Saint'� Rivas, the brother of a drug lord who developed a viral bio-weapon using MODOK's DNA, and Damocles was acting on MODOK's long-suppressed hatred of his form. MODOK had hoped to use Rivas to claim the scheme for himself, but ran afoul of the Falcon and the Anti-Cap. His defeat sent his mind back into his body, where it co-existed with Damocles. Damocles instead hoped to engage the Hulk in battle and thereby destroy MODOKâ€™s form, but Captain America intervened, inspiring Damocles to use MODOK's mental powers to revert the Hulk to Bruce Banner and gain his help to cure the MODOK virus. MODOK was rendered comatose, but he soon reverted to normal to once more lead A.I.M., with all traces of Damocles Rivas expunged."

150,"Nick Fury (Marvel)(01 - Nick Fury, Sr.)",,150_20060721202100_char.jpg,"Slowed aging process, provided by the Infinity Formula.",,"Nicholas Joseph Fury is the son of noted World War I pilot Jack Fury and an alleged descendant of one of the men who wore the Phantom Rider mask in the late nineteenth century. He was born in New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in the late 1910s. Following high school, Fury and his longtime friend Red Hargrove joined Finley's Flying Circus, a traveling air show. They both became excellent pilots and stuntmen. When Finley's Flying Circus came to England in 1940, Fury and Hargrove gave parachuting instructions to Lt. Sam Sawyer, an American soldier attached to the British Army. Weeks later, Sawyer was assigned to rescue a British spy in Holland, and he persuaded Fury and Hargrove to accompany him. Their plane was downed in Holland, where they met circus strongman Timothy 'Dum-Dum' Dugan, who joined their rescue mission. In the end, all five safely returned to England. Inspired by the adventure, Dugan joined the British Army, and in early 1941 Fury and Hargrove returned to America to enlist in the U.S. Army. |||| |||| Fury and Hargrove were soon stationed at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, where Fury rapidly rose to sergeant. On December 7, 1941, Pearl Harbor was attacked by the Japanese and Hargrove was slain. When America declared war on the Axis, Sawyer, now a captain, was reassigned to the U.S. Rangers and instructed to form the First Attack Squad, a special squad of rangers trained in military precision but using individually developed combat techniques. Given virtual carte blanche to handpick Squad members, Sawyer took pains to have Fury appointed field commander. Other recruits included Dugan, black jazz trumpeter Gabe Jones, mechanical expert Izzy Cohen, actor Dino Manelli, lasso-wielding Reb Ralston, and college student Junior Juniper. The Squad members were made honorary commandos in the British army and codenamed 'the Howling Commandos,' or 'Howlers.' Other units under Sawyer's command during the war included Sgt. Bull McGiveney's Maulers, Sgt. Bob Jenkins's Missouri Marauders, Jim Morita's Nisei Squadron, and Combat Kelly's Deadly Dozen. |||| |||| For nearly four years Fury led the Howlers on combat and intelligence missions in virtually every recognized theater of war (and a few more besides). When Juniper was slain in an early mission, he was replaced by eccentric British soldier Pinky Pinkerton; German defector Eric Koenig joined soon afterward, establishing the core membership the Howlers would retain for the remainder of the war, although other soldiers came and went over time. His left eye injured by an enemy grenade, Fury received a Purple Heart but did not leave military service, eventually regaining sight in that eye. The Howlers clashed with many high-ranking German officers, most notably Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker. The Howlers proved so successful that Strucker was ordered to form a similar unit, the Blitzkrieg Squad, but the Howlers always triumphed over their counterparts. Occasional allies of the Howlers included other Sawyer-commanded units, the Marines of Captain Simon Savage's Leatherneck Raiders, and the costumed adventurers Captain America and Bucky. At some point, Fury befriended a Canadian soldier named Logan, secretly a superhuman mutant. |||| |||| Early in the war, separated from the Howlers during a mission in France, Fury was gravely injured by a land mine. Discovered by French partisans, he was taken to a nearby doctor, Professor Berthold Sternberg. Unknown to Fury, Sternberg not only treated Fury's injuries, but also surgically altered Fury so he could withstand inoculation with Sternberg's so-called 'Infinity Formula,' intended to slow or even halt the human aging process. Fury returned to his unit a week later, still unaware of Sternberg's experiment; however, over the course of the war, exposure to Fury's blood introduced the formula into the other Howlers' bloodstreams as well, causing them to remain unusually vital well into old age. Fury returned to France many times during the war, occasionally on intelligence missions from the Office of Strategic Service. |||| |||| Weeks after the unit's formation, the Howlers were assigned to destroy a death ray created by Baron Heinrich Zemo, who destroyed it himself rather than risk its falling into enemy hands; Zemo later became a notorious enemy of Captain America. In mid-1942, while stationed in London, Fury fell in love with Lady Pamela Hawley, a British noblewoman serving in a London ambulance unit. In July of that same year, the Howlers ventured into Romania and met the infamous vampire Dracula, who proved as averse to Nazis as they were. However, the vampiric Nazi agent Baron Blood would later capture the Howlers, though his plans fell apart when an American soldier that he vampirized turned against him. In late 1942, the Howlers were assigned to North Africa, where they saw action alongside nomad leader Desert Hawk and his daughter Sheila, Captain Starr and the Marines of Item Company, and infantryman Combat Casey, among others. |||| |||| In 1943, Fury and Dugan rescued Pam Hawley from the German sorcerer Viscount Krowler, unwittingly intervening in a time-transcending clash between the demonic Dormammu and future Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange, who removed the soldiers' memories of the proceedings. The Howlers faced more magic weeks later when they teamed with adventurous thief Jean Luc LeBeau to keep Baron Strucker from obtaining the time-traveling gem called the Momentary Princess. On a more prosaic note, Fury at last decided to propose marriage to Hawley, but she perished tragically during a London air raid, killed by the raid's final bomb as she was helping the wounded. Months later, when Fury was home on leave, his brother Jake, jealous of Nick's fame, was abducted by the Nazi Colonel Klaue. Nick freed Jake but was captured himself, and Jake helped the Howlers rescue Nick. Following these events, Jake enlisted in the army; he soon regretted his choice, and his resentment of Nick grew. |||| |||| At some point the Nazi mastermind Red Skull infiltrated Fury's base in disguise, though circumstances foiled his mission. In April 1944, the Howlers fought the Skull directly alongside Captain America and Bucky, rescuing an American industrialist. Weeks later, the Howlers pursued Baron Strucker to the German village of Gruenstadt, where they saw him lead a Nazi S.S. Squad in massacring Gruenstadt's entire population. Outraged, the Howlers gunned down Strucker's soldiers to the last man, although Strucker himself escaped. Fury did not know it at the time, but Strucker destroyed Gruenstadt to conceal the nearby discovery of a party of Gnobians, extraterrestrials with vastly advanced technology. After the massacre, Strucker mindlinked with the Gnobian leader, gaining extensive alien knowledge--though he later disputed this--while the Gnobians were infected with his own twisted personality. |||| |||| On June 6, 1944, a.k.a. D-Day, the Howlers were part of the Allied invasion of Nazi-held France. In October they teamed with Captain America and Bucky to face a far different invasion, helping the contemporary Sorcerer Supreme, the Ancient One, against an alliance between Dormammu and the Red Skull; once more, sorcery removed memories of Dormammu from Fury and company. Returning to more conventional warfare, Fury and Cap destroyed one of the Red Skull's biochemical warfare camps weeks later, freeing airman Michael Kramer and other prisoners. The Howlers were also among the Allied forces who halted German advances in the Battle of the Bulge in the last days of 1944. In 1945, the Howlers had yet another brush with the unworldly in Berlin, where centuries-old sorcerer Algernon Crowe was creating zombie soldiers for the Nazis. The Howlers incapacitated the zombies and torched Crowe's facility, believing Crowe to be dead. |||| |||| When the war finally ended in August 1945, Fury led the Howlers on European 'mop-up' missions against remaining Axis operatives. It was during this period that the Howlers shut down the death camp laboratories of Nathaniel Essex, a.k.a. Mister Sinister. Fury was then reassigned to Okinawa, Japan to shut down remnants there, while the other Howlers returned to civilian life. |||| |||| Fury was soon recruited by the O.S.S. full-time. Working with agents of the British MI-5, he was sent after Colonel Ishii, a renegade Japanese scientist with a cache of bio-weapons; Fury captured Ishii, but was the mission's only survivor. In 1946, Fury aged sixty years in minutes due to long-term effects of Sternberg's Infinity Formula; Sternberg, having anticipated this, had mailed Fury a mutated version of the formula, and Fury immediately inoculated himself with it, restoring his youth. However, the effect lasted only one year, and Sternberg began extorting money from Fury in exchange for a yearly supply of the formula. Unable to locate Sternberg, Fury acquiesced and bought doses from him for the next several decades. |||| |||| When the O.S.S. disbanded in 1947, Fury was reassigned to Army Intelligence and eventually saw action in the Korean War, which began in 1950; at some point, Fury re-formed the Howling Commandos, who re-enlisted for a special mission to blow up a missile base behind enemy lines. At the successful close of this mission, Fury was promoted to second lieutenant and soon afterward transferred to the Central Intelligence Agency. In this capacity, he led a unit known as Team Valkyrie until the war's end in 1953. At some point in the late 1950s or early 1960s, Fury worked with the super-team called the First Line and was particularly impressed by their leader, Yankee Clipper. By 1963, Fury was a C.I.A. colonel in charge of a program involving telepathic operatives, one of whom, Theresa Bellwether, was murdered as part of a defense operation called Project: About Face. The ultimate fate of Fury's program is unrevealed, but by 1967 he was active in the Vietnam War, where he again re-formed the Howling Commandos as volunteers on special assignment; a year later, he underwent training in the Green Beret Special Forces, which he followed up with Black Beret training in 1973. Little else is known of Fury's C.I.A. activities, although during this period he frequently worked with his wartime comrade Logan, now a Canadian intelligence operative. Fury's tactics and talents earned him many rivals, including a deadly intelligence operative known only as the Spook. |||| |||| In the early 1980s, Fury investigated a reorganized First Line and aided them against subterranean invaders; following his report, he was recommended for 'Project S.H.I.E.L.D.,' a government operation still many years from completion. Later, Fury went undercover in Macao to investigate Amber D'Alexis, who ran an espionage and weapons smuggling ring out of her casino; Fury romanced D'Alexis to win her confidence, only to learn that she was romantically involved with his brother Jake, now a biophysics researcher. Fury ultimately took D'Alexis into custody, and Jake's resentment turned into hatred. A few years later, Fury re-formed the Howling Commandos at least once more, for a mission with pilot Ben Grimm. During the same time frame, Fury worked with two brilliant scientists, Reed Richards and Tony Stark; unknown to Fury, both men were involved in Project S.H.I.E.L.D., and Jake Fury soon became a Stark employee. |||| |||| In recent years, not long after the debut of the Fantastic Four, Nick Fury aided the team against the subversive Hate-Monger. Following this mission, Fury was assigned to investigate a spy at Stark International, unaware that Stark himself was involved in the new international espionage unit known as S.H.I.E.L.D. (Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law-enforcement Division), the finalized version of Project: S.H.I.E.L.D., whose director, Colonel Rick Stoner, had recently been slain by the high-tech terrorists Hydra. Fury was dismayed to discover that the spy was his brother Jake, who had defected to Hydra. Confronting his brother, Fury was shot in the left eye, exacerbating his old war injury. Though his operations were exposed, Jake escaped, and Nick, his left eye now almost totally useless, began wearing an eyepatch. Shortly afterward, a mission in Russia again teamed him with Logan, now the Canadian super-agent Wolverine. |||| |||| Returning to America, Fury was, at Stark's recommendation, recruited to head S.H.I.E.L.D., which was facing renewed attacks from Hydra. Fury was dubious of his own qualifications but accepted the role, soon recruiting Dum-Dum Dugan, who became his second-in-command, as well as Gabe Jones and Eric Koenig. Fury led S.H.I.E.L.D. against Hydra, A.I.M., the Druid, and other terrorists; never one to risk subordinates' lives on jobs he could do himself, Fury continued to act as a field agent. His right-hand man was Jasper Sitwell, a loyal administrator whose dedication to the rules irked Fury almost as much as it grounded him, while much of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s developing technology was overseen by Sidney 'the Gaffer' Levine, a brilliant inventor and, like Fury, a veteran of a wartime unit, in his case the high-tech Skywolves. During his early clashes with Hydra, Fury fell in love with Laura Brown, daughter of the organization's supposed leader, the Imperial Hydra; when the Imperial Hydra was slain in one clash, Fury believed Hydra was on its last legs, but its creed of 'cut off one arm and another shall take its place' would soon prove itself true. When Fury's relationship with Brown ended, he began romancing fellow agent Contessa Valentina de Fontaine. |||| |||| Mere months after joining S.H.I.E.L.D., Fury was reunited with his wartime friend Captain America, who had been revived from decades of suspended animation by the Avengers. Ironically, Fury faced a more unhappy reunion when he learned that Hydra, founded in the closing days of World War II, was secretly led by none other than Baron Strucker, who tried to blackmail the world with a so-called Death-Spore bomb; however, Fury located the bomb and sealed it in Hydra's domed island base, where it apparently killed only Strucker and his men. On the heels of this victory, Fury was almost driven mad when he became a pawn in a game between Latverian dictator Doctor Doom and his robot opponent, the Prime Mover. In the course of the game, S.H.I.E.L.D. clashed with a robot of the megalomaniacal Yellow Claw, and when the true Claw's nemesis, FBI agent Jimmy Woo, became involved in the proceedings, Fury recruited him for S.H.I.E.L.D. |||| |||| |||| Another foe resurfaced when Jake Fury, empowered by the mysterious Zodiac Key, attacked S.H.I.E.L.D. as Scorpio; eventually exposed, Scorpio clashed with Fury repeatedly until his apparent death, although his consciousness survived in an android body. A final bit of Fury's past was laid to rest when Professor Sternberg was slain by criminal Steel Harris, who attempted to up the extortion on Fury's supply of the Infinity Formula; however, with the help of de la Fontaine, Fury defeated Steel and obtained the secrets of the Infinity Formula for himself. |||| |||| |||| As S.H.I.E.L.D. director, Fury fought various superhuman foes alongside New York's super heroes, many of whom he befriended. When the Thing and a handful of Avengers organized a floating poker game, Fury became a regular participant; at one such game he renewed his friendship with Wolverine, now a member of the mutant X-Men. Despite his respect for super heroes, Fury recognized them as potential loose cannons, and S.H.I.E.L.D. formed more than one contingency plan against them. For years, Fury balanced his duties against his friendships, not always to his own satisfaction. As S.H.I.E.L.D.'s influence spread, Fury became concerned about internal corruption and worked with ex-agent Mockingbird to expose several criminal operations. Fury became the target of the seven-section organization the Sept, who attacked S.H.I.E.L.D.'s airborne Helicarrier base, overthrew a small Latin American government, attacked Fury and his men in Egypt, and were tracked to Hong Kong, where Fury unmasked their leader, the One, as the true Yellow Claw. A few years later, while investigating use of the Zodiac Key, Fury was stunned to meet a new Scorpio named Mikel Fury, who claimed to be Jake Fury's son by Amber D'Alexis. Working alongside Wolverine, Fury shut down D'Alexis's latest criminal operation, but D'Alexis herself held Fury at gunpoint and revealed that Nick, not Jake, was Mikel's father. D'Alexis was defeated by Wolverine shortly afterward, and Fury took Mikel into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, although he soon escaped. |||| |||| Soon afterward, Fury learned that S.H.I.E.L.D. had been infiltrated by artificial life-forms called Deltites, who deceived most of Fury's agents, including de la Fontaine, into turning against him. Fury and a handful of loyal agents eventually defeated the Deltites, but not before almost all remaining S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were seemingly slain; unknown to Fury, the Deltites had been directed by Baron Strucker, alive after all, who kept the supposedly dead agents in stasis. S.H.I.E.L.D. was formally disbanded, and Fury traveled the world to close S.H.I.E.L.D.'s bases and destroy its most dangerous technology. Physically and emotionally exhausted, Fury briefly retired in the company of agent Kate Neville, who became his lover. |||| |||| Months later, Fury left retirement to join de la Fontaine, Neville, and others against the Death's Head Guard, Gnobians altered by former Nazi geneticist Arnim Zola and driven by Strucker's hatred of Fury. The Guard slew hundreds of American agents before Fury managed to break through their programming, after which they committed mass suicide; Strucker later implied that the aliens were in fact creations of Hydra, but this claim seems dubious given the Gnobians' wartime activities. Soon afterward, a new S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate), designed to be less vulnerable to corruption, was formed, and Fury became its director. Under Fury, the new S.H.I.E.L.D. renewed ties with the superhuman community and faced enemies both new and old, including Algernon Crowe, one of the leaders of Mys-Tech, which combined science and magic in pursuit of conquest. Investigating Mys-Tech's greatest threat, the reality-altering Un-Earth, Fury was slain by Crowe, only to be resurrected when American and British super heroes reversed time to defeat Mys-Tech. Fury later teamed with the United Kingdom's Super-Soldiers against Hydra's Warlord Huang Zhu in the Savage Land. |||| |||| Despite the new S.H.I.E.L.D.'s early successes, tragedy again struck when Hydra massacred hundreds of new S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, but Hydra inadvertently provided replacements when Fury discovered the comatose agents believed slain by the Deltites. Learning of Strucker's survival, Fury again confronted his nemesis and defeated him, although Strucker eluded capture. Reunited with his longtime agents and friends, Fury set about expanding S.H.I.E.L.D., which eventually neared the size and complexity of its predecessor. Fury even made peace with his son Mikel, whom he recruited as an agent to help him when internal strife in Hydra fueled subversive activity in his home neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen. |||| |||| Sometime later, Fury received a coded distress message from someone called Fallen Angel, who claimed to be Rick Stoner, long believed dead. Commissioning a specialized LMD (Life Model Decoy) android duplicate from Tony Stark, Fury left the duplicate in his place and traced the signal to Project: Backslide, an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. experiment, only to be pulled into a pocket dimension with Fallen Angel, who, regardless of his true identity, died shortly afterward, leaving Fury stranded for months. Unknown to Fury, his LMD duplicate captured and tried to rehabilitate the killer vigilante Punisher; however, the Spook, Fury's longtime rival, brainwashed the Punisher into assassinating the LMD, believed by all to be Fury. Meanwhile, Fury's subconscious had remade the pocket dimension into a duplicate of wartime Europe, where he relived past Howlers missions. He regained his senses through the arrival of Sharon Carter, an agent of the prior S.H.I.E.L.D., long thought dead; although Carter had come seeking vengeance on Fury, she ultimately helped him return to Earth. Fury briefly stepped down from S.H.I.E.L.D. directorship, leaving Carter to succeed him, but he soon returned, driving himself harder than ever. One of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most serious setbacks came when the Helicarrier was hijacked by the Red Skull, who joined forces with the Hate-Monger in an effort to spread hatred across the world, but the villains were defeated by Fury, Captain America, and their fellow wartime veteran, Namor the Sub-Mariner. |||| |||| Ultimately, despite Fury's best efforts, the second incarnation of S.H.I.E.L.D. has proven no more immune to corruption than the first, and Fury has grown dubious of some of the agency's more inhumane operations, such as the so-called Deathlok project. Fury even briefly lost command of S.H.I.E.L.D., being demoted to a desk job. Despite ending the threat of former Hydra agent Rudy Gargarin on Napoleon Island, Fury had to struggle to regain his position. Moreover, as superhuman incidents become more widespread and devastating, Fury, despite his efforts to steer government attention away from such allies as Spider-Man and Daredevil, has found himself at odds with the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, and even his old friends Captain America and Wolverine, whom he has been reduced to manipulating on more than one mission, including a recent foray into Latveria that left hard feelings all around and resulted in Fury losing directorship of S.H.I.E.L.D. and going into hiding. Fury is now working underground. It remains to be seen how long Fury can tread the line between conflicting loyalties."

1709,Porcupine (Marvel)(01 - Alex Gentry),Alexander Gentry ,1709_20061110061049_char.jpg,,,"The character was originally created as a weapons designer for the United States Army, conceived the idea of designing a battlesuit in imitation of a porcupine: it would be covered with quill-like projections for defense. Moreover, it would be able to shoot its quills, or gases, chemicals, or weapons from quill-like tubes, at an opponent. (In actuality, a porcupine cannot shoot its quills, although they can be detached from its body) Gentry spent months working on overtime to create his porcupine battlesuit. He was enormously proud of his achievement when the suit was finished, and believed his invention was worth a fortune. Yet Gentry also believed that the government would pay him, one of its employees, virtually nothing for his creation. Angrily, Gentry decided to keep the porcupine battlesuit and to use it to make himself wealthy through crime. Thus Gentry became the Porcupine, one of the first costumed criminals of his generation. |||| |||| Hank Pym, who was then the original Ant-Man, and his partner, Janet van Dyne, the Wasp, soon defeated the Porcupine. However, the Porcupine succeeded in escaping, and unsuccessfully tried to take revenge on them after Pym had also assumed the superhuman powers and identity of Giant-Man. During a battle with Giant-Man, the Porcupine stole and consumed a large number of what he thought were the capsules that Giant-Man used to grow in size. In fact, though, they were the capsules Giant-Man used to shrink himself, and the Porcupine shrank out of sight. |||| |||| Eventually, however, the capsules' effect wore off, and the Porcupine, again at his normal size, was among the many costumed menaces assembled by Doctor Doom to disrupt the wedding of Reed Richards and Susan Storm. |||| |||| His self-confidence still shaken by his failures in battling Giant-Man and the Wasp, the Porcupine eagerly accepted the invitation of Count Nefaria, a powerful figure in the criminal Maggia, to join his group of costumed agents. Among Nefaria's agents were the original Eel, the Plantman, and the Scarecrow, with all of whom the Porcupine would ally himself in the future as well. The Porcupine and the other costumed agents aided Count Nefaria in his attempt to hold much of Washington D.C. for ransom. However, the original X-Men thwarted Nefaria and his agents. Once again, the Porcupine succeeded in escaping being taken prisoner, and he blamed the failure of the blackmail scheme on Nefaria and the other agents. But Gentry suspected that in fact, he himself was inadequate for the role of being a 'super-villain' battling superhuman opponents. |||| |||| It is not known what the Porcupine did between the end of this venture and his enlistment as a member of Batroc's Brigade. As a Brigade member, the Porcupine unsuccessfully battled Captain America. Months later, the Porcupine and his allies the original Eel, the Plantman, and the Scarecrow, went to work for the masked criminal mastermind who called himself the Cowled Commander. Once again, the Porcupine clashed with Captain America but was defeated. |||| |||| Convinced that they were failures, Gentry and Leopold Stryke, who was the original Eel, sought guidance from the Celestial Mind Control movement, which was secretly masterminded by the alien Nebulon. Nebulon pitted the Porcupine and the Eel against his foes, the costumed adventurers called the Defenders, who defeated them both. |||| |||| Later, the Porcupine and a small group of confederates invaded a major Manhattan hotel to steal the valuables in its safe. This time the Porcupine erred by deciding to rob the wealthy attendees at a fashion show in one of the hotel's ballrooms. Unfortunately for him, the show as being given by fashion designer Janet van Dyne, who was also the Wasp. Moreover, Henry Pym, who now used the costumed identity of Yellowjacket, was also present, as was Kyle Richmond, the adventurer called Nighthawk. The Wasp, Yellowjacket, and Nighthawk quickly defeated the criminals, and the Porcupine felt humiliated at being overpowered by the Wasp and Yellowjacket when they were both at the size of insects. |||| |||| Perhaps believing there was safety in numbers, the Porcupine next turned up as one of a large assemblage of costumed criminals organized by the original versions of Libra and Sagittarius of the android Zodiac. This time the Porcupine was defeated by the Hellcat during a battle between a number of the criminals and a group of adventurers operating under the auspices of the Defenders. |||| |||| The Porcupine went to prison but was soon released by minions of billionaire Justin Hammer. The Porcupine agreed to provide Hammer with half the proceeds from his criminal activities in exchange for Hammer's financial support. The Porcupine was among the small army of costumed criminals whom Hammer sent to attack Iron Man when the latter turned up on Hammer's enormous 'houseboat' headquarters. Iron Man succeeded in defeating all of these criminals. Presumably the Porcupine's failure in this instance was one of the reasons that Hammer fired the Porcupine from his employ. |||| |||| Tired of his long string of defeats, Gentry believed his criminal career had become a joke. He decided to give up his career as a costumed criminal and live off the millions of dollars he expected to receive by selling his battlesuit. Gentry totally redesigned his porcupine battlesuit, making it far deadlier than before. He entered into negotiations with the subversive organization called the Secret Empire to sell them the suit. The Empire requested proof of the battlesuit's capabilities, so Gentry said he would prove it was the perfect combat suit by testing it in battle against Captain America, the ultimate soldier. But Captain America and his ally Nomad defeated the Porcupine, and Gentry was returned to jail. |||| |||| In prison, Gentry vowed never to be defeated again, and to ensure that, he decided never to put on the Porcupine battlesuit again. Gentry was soon released from prison, apparently legally, under unknown circumstances, and he set about once more to try to sell the battlesuit. But by now Porcupine was seemingly universally regarded by major criminals and leading subversive organizations as a laughable failure, and hence they saw his battlesuit as virtually worthless to them. Gentry tried to sell it to the Secret Empire, AIM, HYDRA, the Kingpin, the Maggia, the Tinkerer, various others, and finally to the Serpent Society, but almost no one wanted it, and the few offers he did receive for it were insultingly low. |||| |||| Gentry was in despair, but finally came up with the idea of selling the battlesuit to the Avengers to prevent it from falling into the hands of their enemies. Captain America was intrigued by Gentry's proposal, and in talking to Gentry, learned that he knew how to contact the Serpent Society, whom Captain America had been trying to bring to justice. Captain America agreed to have the Avengers buy the battlesuit if Gentry helped get him to members of the Serpent Society. Gentry accepted Captain America's terms. |||| |||| Captain America's plan was for Gentry to pretend to have captured him and to offer the Serpent Society the opportunity to kill him. Gentry contacted the Society's leader, Sidewinder, and arranged to have some of the Society Members meet him at a lower Manhattan construction site. Gentry, having reluctantly donned his Porcupine costume once more as part of the plan, pretended to guard Captain America, who was seemingly bound with chains. Gentry was frightened and did not want to have to do any fighting, but Captain America told him he could leave as soon as he had turned the Captain over to the Society members. |||| |||| Four Society members soon appeared: Cottonmouth, Death Adder, Diamondback, and the Rattler. Captain America took the Society members by surprise, and the Porcupine began to flee. Diamondback, realizing that the Porcupine had set them up, went after him and threw two nitroglycerin-filled diamond weapons at him. The weapons exploded on impact, damaging his battlesuit somewhat, but not harming him. Nevertheless, seeing his only valuable asset, the costume, damaged, Gentry flew into a rage and attacked Diamondback. She again damaged his suit somehow, and as he tried to escape her, he tripped and fell. |||| |||| Due to the damage to his suit Gentry was impaled on one of his own quills when he fell. Apparently, the quill went into his heart, for the injury proved fatal. Diamondback escaped, but Captain America defeated the other three Society members. Captain America found Gentry dying and in despair. Gentry said that 'I'm going to die as I lived…one big loser.' Captain America tried to reassure Gentry, told him he had helped him defeat three Serpent Society members, and that therefore Gentry was a hero. But Gentry refused to believe the Captain's kind words, saying that he, Gentry, was 'nothing' and had led a worthless life. Captain America replied that Gentry had proved to be a worthy opponent, but it is not known whether this compliment mattered to Gentry, for he expired seconds later without having said another word. |||| |||| In tribute to Gentry, Captain America had him buried in a grave reserved by the Avengers for those who have fallen in battle, and put his battlesuit on exhibit in Avengers Mansion, labeled 'Battle Armor of the Porcupine — Honored Foe of the Avengers'."

Their means of conquest is most unusual. They send out ships across the galaxy, searching out planets in the early stages of development. Once the ship lands in the most inhospitable location available on the planet, it sends out a hypnotic signal which summons one of each life form on the planet. The life form that arrives first at the ship is quickly disected and its genetic code implanted on millions of egg-pairs. The egg-pairs are then ejected across the world where they will find their mate and begin their conquest of the planet. When a Plodex ship approached earth, something went wrong, and it crash landed. The egg-pairs were ejected without genetic imprinting. |||| |||| |||| One of the eggs managed to survive for tens of thousands of years beneath the atlantic ocean. The egg was found by Tom Smallwood when he was washed overboard of his fishing boat. He returned to the his Newfoundland home, and gave the egg to his wife Gladys. When Gladys broke the shell she imprinted Marrina with human female DNA. Marrina grew up mostly normal, except for her odd appearance. She joined Department H when she was approximately 16 and was the first member of Gamma Flight. She quickly rose to Beta Flight and, by the time that Department H's funding was cut she was ready to become a member of Alpha Flight.When Alpha Flight became independent, she joined the team as an active member. |||| |||| The, malevolent self proclaimed, Master Of The World had discovered the lost Plodex ship, and there had learned of it's nature. He also learned of the hatching of one of the egg pairs, one of whom was Marrina. The Master used the Plodex ship to summon, and capture Marrina. In doing so she went wild, and nearly killed her friend, and teammate, Puck. She was rescued not long after by Alpha Flight, with assistance from Namor, and The Invisible Woman. Once free Marrina decided to take some time to see the world, and left with Namor to visit Atlantis. Inevitably the two fell in love. The Master had come to control Marrina's intended mate, the other surviving Plodex Egg. This mate however had evolved into a monstrous sea monster, that The Master set loose killing people. Puck called upon Marrina and Namor to investigate the killings. While Marrina was in close proximity to the beast, it triggered her bestial side. She attacked Puck and Namor before the three of them were captured by The Master. They managed to escape, and destroy The Master's submarine, and in the process Marrina slipped away in shame. Being normally very sweet natured, her dark side was difficult for her to face, and she did not want her beloved Namor to see see it. |||| |||| |||| It was at this time that she was captured by the Atlantean warlord, Attuma. He used her now monstrous appearance to turn the people of Atlantis against Namor. A great battle ensued |||| with Alpha Flight and the Avengers, against the forces of Attuma. Marrina fled the battle, and began to grow odd pustules on her skin. It seemed that during her exposer to her Plodex mate in the Master's submarine, the two had mated, and she was now pregnant. The pustules on her flesh we in fact egg pods, almost ready to hatch. When Namor and Alpha flight caught up with Marrina, they discovered her Plodex Mate had also arrived, to protect her through the hatching of the eggs. In a moment of defiance, Marrina rejected her alien heritage, inspired by her love for her friends and family, and for Namor. She managed to completely reject the eggs growing in her skin, destroying them. The heroes slew her monstrous Plodex Mate, and she and Namor were wed. |||| |||| |||| Marrina and Namor took the Atlanteans who remained loyal to Namor, and founded a new aquatic nation called Deluvia. Eventually that nation fell, and Namor joined the forces of the Avengers, with Marrina becoming a close associate of the team. Through her relationship with Namor, Marrina became pregnant, and transformed into a giant sea creature called Leviathan. Namor was forced to slay his beloved with the the Black Knight's Ebony Blade. Before she died however, she Marrina had managed to lay at least 3 eggs, which the Avengers discovered had hatched. |||| |||| When Llan the Sorcerer revived The Master Of The World from a comatose state, he informed him that Marrina 'Sleeps a false death under the waves'. |||| |||| Years later, Marrina was found alive by Norman Osborn in her transformed state.

2400,Flatman (Marvel),Val Ventura ,2400_20160827104015_char.jpg,Flatman is basically two-dimensional. He can stretch to impossible lengths and has rubbery skin that prevents him from physical injury.,,"Astrophysicist Val Ventura is a founding member and deputy leader of the Milwaukee-based would-be super-team the Great Lakes Avengers. The most level-headed member of the team, Ventura has often been mistaken for world-renowned scientist Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four. Though he is an accomplished scientist in his own right, Ventura is rarely taken seriously by his peers, which has led to him being eager to cooperate with authorities, such as when he and his teammates assisted S.H.I.E.L.D. in an attempt to apprehend the then-fugitive Thunderbolts in the Colorado Rockies. Recently, the GLA realized they were all mutants and changed their name to the Great Lakes X-Men to avoid a lawsuit. Ventura also recently came to terms with his sexuality, and admitted to his teammates that he is gay."

106,Wonder Woman (DC)(Post Crisis)(01 - Diana),Princess/Ambassador Diana of Themyscira ,106_20051121225911_char.jpg,,,"Though she's commonly thought of as the original super-heroine, Princess Diana was merely the first one to achieve profound levels of popularity, and certainly is the earliest example to have had a relatively constant presence from World War II to the present day. |||| |||| It would be hard to overstate her importance to the superhero genre, but it would be relatively simple to mistakenly think that like Superman and Batman, she's been seen monthly since the Golden Age. |||| |||| There have, in fact, been several 'gaps' in her publication history, the most significant of which was virtually the whole of the 1950s. She was one of the principle heroes targeted by the Congressional investigation into comic book morality--for lack of the official name. Though most modern observers would find the early 50s criticisms of her patently absurd, the charges stuck, and the superhero genre nearly died amidst talk of Wonder Woman's unhealthy obsession with bondage, lesbianism and inappropriate independence from men. |||| |||| As events have transpired in the DCU since the 1950s, most all of her wartime appearances have been officially retconned, and her initial membership in the Justice Society has now been retroactively ascribed to her mother, Hippolyta. Thus, even though we might see Diana appearing for the first time in All-Star Comics #8, DC would like us to believe, now, that all of her appearances in the original JSA run in fact happened to her mother, Hippolyta. Consequently her 'first appearance' is now quite confusing, because Diana is shown to be the one clearly appearing 'as Wonder Woman', and Hippolyta is clearly shown to be there simply as Queen and mother of Diana. Oddly enough, the first appearance of Wonder Woman must now be retconned completely out of existence in the post-CRISIS world. For these reasons, this character included so you don't drive yourself crazy trying to figure out things 'from a post-Crisis perspective'. If the story happened since the February 1987 Pérez reboot following Crisis on Infinite Earths , use this character."

1760,Rhino (Marvel)(01 - Aleksei Sytsevich),Aleksei Mikhailovich Sytsevich ,1760_20070225062240_char.jpg,"As a result of being bonded to a powerful polymer suit, as well as being innately powerful, the Rhino possesses tremendous physical strength. He also has heightened levels of speed, stamina, and a high degree of resistance to physical injury. The Rhino's costume renders him highly resistant to conventional injury, withstanding high caliber bullets, temperature extremes, and great impacts without injury. |||| |||| Originally the source of the Rhino's powers was his costume which resembles a rhinoceros, which was once permanently attached. Eventually, the abilities of the costume merged with the body of the wearer. He has been physically improved over the years by several other villains.","Because of the weight of his suit, he has limited mobility. The costume is unremovable and, because of exposure of his face, he is susceptable to gas.","The Rhino was initially Aleksei Sytsevich, a poor immigrant from Russia who was desperate to pay for the rest of his family to come to America. With little education and no real skills, the only paying jobs he could get were using his impressive strength and musculature as an enforcer for various criminal organizations. One day he was contacted by some Eastern Bloc agents, who offered him a vast sum of money for participating in an incredible experiment. Sytsevich agreed, and was subjected to intensive chemical and radioactive treatment, which bonded a super-strong polymer to his skin and greatly augmented his strength and speed. He was given the code name 'Rhino,' and was sent to work as a super-assassin. |||| |||| Rhino's first job was to capture Colonel John Jameson for his military secrets. Spider-Man defeated the Rhino, leading to the supervillain's arrest. After escaping from prison, Rhino has taken on many other jobs over the years, and although he still hates Spider-Man and would love to crush him, he is professional enough not to let personal feelings distract him from a paying job. |||| |||| Physically, he is one of Spider-Man's strongest foes with his favored attack being ramming into a target with a sustained charge."
