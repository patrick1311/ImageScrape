13,Angel (Marvel)(03 - Warren Worthington III),Warren Kenneth Worthington III ,13_20051203110123_char.jpg,"Angel has fully feathered wings that span 16' and have a very flexible skeletal structure. He can fly by flapping his wings, and can reach speeds of up to 150 mph. Though he generally flies below the height of clouds at 6,500 feet, Angel can reach a height of 10,000 feet with little effort. His wings are strong enough to carry aloft at least 200 pounds in addition to his own body weight. Angel's entire anatomy is adapted for flight, having hollow bones; a body virtually devoid of fat, granting him enhanced proportionate muscle strength; eyes that can withstand high-speed winds; enhanced eyesight enabling him to see at distances far greater than the average human; and a special respiratory membrane that extracts oxygen from the air at extreme velocities and altitudes. |||| |||| Angel is a skilled combatant, especially in aerial hand-to-hand combat. He is also a talented businessman whose wealth ranks him in the lower part of the Fortune 500 list. |||| |||| See the entry on Archangel for information on his secondary mutation. ||||",,"Warren Worthington III was born in Centerport, New York to Kathryn Worthington and Warren Worthington Jr. He was attending a private school in his adolescence when white, feathered wings began to grow from his shoulder blades. At first Warren felt he was a freak, but he soon learned that he could use his wings to fly and to help people. When there was a fire in his dormitory, he borrowed some props from the school's drama department, dressed up as a 'heavenly' angel and rescued his friends. He soon learned that he in fact is a mutant. He donned a mask and costume and called himself the Avenging Angel and was a solo adventurer originally. |||| |||| He then began attending the Xavier School For Gifted Youngsters, where Professor Charles Xavier trained young mutants to control their powers and use them for good. Taking the code name Angel, Worthington became one of the original members of the superhero team the X-Men. |||| |||| For a time, he was romantically interested in Jean Grey, but eventually he realized that Jean was in love with Scott Summers and gave up the pursuit. |||| |||| While pursuing Sauron in the Savage Land, Angel was attacked by Pteranodons and fell to his death. He was brought back to life by an uncostumed Magneto, who was known as Creator in the Savage Land. Presumed dead, Magneto had been gathering a mutant army. |||| |||| When the original X-Men were captured by the mutant island Krakoa, Professor X created a new team of X-Men to rescue them. When this new team of X-Men decided to stay, Angel and the rest of the original team, with the exception of Cyclops, left the team. He and Iceman went to Los Angeles, where they founded the Champions with Hercules, the Black Widow, and the original Ghost Rider. Following the apparent death of Jean Grey and Cyclops' subsequent exile from the team, Warren rejoined the X-Men to help pick up the slack. During this time, Angel grew increasingly disturbed by the behavior and actions of Wolverine, and after some time quit the team in protest. |||| |||| He was once kidnapped by the Morlock leader Callisto and stripped of most of his clothing. Callisto attempted to humiliate him. He could not remember anything else at the time as he was unconscious. Just then, Storm, Nightcrawler, Colossus, and Sprite arrived to stop Callisto, but they were also captured by the Morlocks and tied to stakes. Storm struck a deal with Callisto: a battle to the death without powers. They would duel with knives, with the winner keeping Angel and having the leadership of the Morlocks. Storm won, but spared Callisto's life. Shortly thereafter, Angel joined the Defenders. |||| |||| The Defenders did not last much longer with Angel, Iceman, and Beast being the sole survivors. They had decided to abandon the hero's life, but with the resurrection of Jean Grey, the five original X-Men chose to form X-Factor. During this period, Warren found himself giving Jean more emotional support than Cyclops was, who was going through intense emotional repercussions while trying to deal with the fact that Jean was still alive in conjunction with his own involvement with Madelyne Pryor (who was later revealed to be a clone of Jean). |||| |||| Archangel |||| |||| Much later, having joined his teammates as a member of X-Factor, Warren's wings were severely damaged during the Mutant Massacre by Harpoon. Cameron Hodge—whom Warren had known for years and considered a friend, yet was secretly anti-mutant—had his wings amputated. Despondent over the loss of his wings, Warren escaped the hospital and commandeered his private jet, which exploded in the air as the rest of X-Factor watched helplessly from below. It was revealed that Hodge had sabotaged Warren's ultralight airplane to create the illusion that the depressed Warren had tried to commit suicide. |||| |||| Before the explosion, Warren was spirited away by the ancient mutant Apocalypse. Apocalypse altered Warren's appearance, giving him blue skin, organic metal wings, and the ability to fire his metal feathers as projectiles. He also gave him the title of Death, the leader of his Horsemen. When it appeared as though Death had killed his former teammate Iceman, he overcame Apocalypse's brainwashing. Hungry for revenge, he tracked down Hodge. Hodge had kidnapped Warren's lover, Candy Southern, and killed her. Warren beheaded Hodge with his wings, seemingly killing him (it was later revealed that Hodge's head still lived in the X-Tinction Agenda crossover). Warren did not rejoin X-Factor immediately afterwards, spending some time as a loner called 'Dark Angel' due to his state of mind following Southern's death. After the events of Inferno, he finally rejoined X-Factor, taking the name Archangel at Beast's urging. It was around this point that he became romantically involved with Charlotte Jones, a New York City Police officer who helped to rescue Warren and the rest of X-Factor from the Ravens, a cult of near-immortal psychic vampires. |||| |||| After rejoining the X-Men, Archangel became romantically involved with Psylocke. Warren soon traded in his 'Death' garb for his old blue and white costume, signifying he was attempting to put his dark days behind him. After Psylocke was eviscerated by X-Men prisoner Sabretooth during an escape attempt, Warren and the X-Men tracked down and captured him, but not before he was able to badly damage Warren's metal wings. Over time, the damage to his wings spread. Eventually the metal wings shattered completely, revealing that his feathered wings had been growing back within them and broke them apart from the inside. This followed a visit from Ozymandias, who told him that he was indeed one of Apocalypse's chosen ones. Reclaiming his original codename Angel, Warren still retained his blue skin color. Having both experienced drastic changes in their lives, Psylocke and Warren found themselves growing apart, while Psylocke began showing attraction for new X-Men recruit Thunderbird. Realizing they were no longer on the same path, Warren ended their relationship, wishing her happiness in the future. |||| |||| Warren remained a member of one of the core X-Men teams, where he served as co-leader with Nightcrawler. In a fight with Black Tom Cassidy, Angel experienced a 'secondary mutation'. His blood gained advanced healing properties, giving him the ability to heal quickly from wounds and allowing him to heal others when his blood is mixed with theirs. This new power 'healed' Warren's skin from Apocalypse's alterations, turning his blue pallor back to its original shade. Warren discovered his ability to heal others when he saved the life of teammate Husk (Paige Guthrie) after she was severely injured in battle. He has since become involved in a controversial romance with Paige, who is several years his junior. It was also revealed during The Draco storyline that his blood dealt much pain to Nightcrawler. Also in the same storyline it is hinted by Azazel, Nightcrawler and Abyss's father, that Archangel may actually be related to an ancient civilization of Angel like mutants who had banished Azazel and his people from Earth into another Dimension. Apparently this is the same dimension through which Kurt a.k.a Nightcrawler passes through while teleporting. |||| |||| Warren and Paige took an extended leave of absence, and Archangel launched a charity called 'Mutantes Sans Frontières' in Zanzibar, (a reference to Doctors Without Borders), where he then proceeded to help stop a coup with the aid of Professor X's newest charges from nearby Genosha. In 'Excalibur,' Warren met up again with Callisto. As Paige reminded Warren of his history with Callisto, Viper attacked. Warren and Callisto then managed to defeat Viper together. In Generation M, it appeared that Angel's wings had shrunken and shriveled into a useless state following the events of House of M. However, it was revealed that Warren had managed to fake losing his mutant abilities in order to lure out The Ghoul, a deranged serial killer who uses his retained mutant powers to murder ex-mutants. |||| |||| Archangel joined with fellow former Champions member Hercules, along with Namora, and Amadeus Cho to attempt to calm down The Hulk in the Incredible Hulk #107. In their attempts to help save New York City from the destruction, they form a new team of superheroes, called the Renegades."

Amora prefers to use sorcery and seduction. Few can resist her beauty, particularly when she augments it with her magic; a single kiss is often enough to make a man her slave. She is one of the most powerful mystics in Asgard or on Earth, capable of energy blasts, protective shields, illusions, levitation, teleportation, conjuring, interdimensional travel, transmutation, time-disruption and mind control. As her sorcerous powers stem largely from Asgardian sources, her magic is strongest within the realm of Asgard and gradually diminishes the longer she remains outside of Asgard, though her powers never fade completely.",,"Amora the Enchantress, An Asgardian Goddess and immensely powerful magical sorcerer. Being backed by years of experience, she is one of Thor's greatest and most powerful foes not only because of her immense power, but also because of him being her love interest. |||| |||| *** SILVER AGE *** |||| Amora first appeared as a foe of Thor, albeit with the intention of seducing him and then soon after as an enemy of the Avengers. |||| |||| The Enchantress' parentage is unknown, though it is known she has a sister by the name of Lorelei. In time, Amora became one of the more powerful magic-wielders in Asgard, with her magical arsenal focused on (but not limited to) charming and mind-controlling people. Her by now well renowned beauty did not hinder in this. |||| |||| Amora has devoted her immortal life to the pursuit of power and pleasure, using sorcery and sexuality as her tools. Born into the Asgardian gods, Amora studied under the mighty sorceress Karnilla The Norn Queen, who ultimately expelled her for being too undisciplined. Amora went on to study under many other Asgardian mages, often seducing them to learn their secrets. By the time she reached adulthood, Amora was a powerful sorceress, famous for her beauty and infamous for her heartless scheming. An early alliance with the warrior goddess Brunnhilde the Valkyrie ended with Amora trapping Brunnhilde's soul, using the Valkyrie's vacated form as a shell for herself and various pawns to inhabit over the centuries that followed. Brunnhilde would eventually return, becoming one of Amora's bitterest enemies. |||| |||| Amora's longest-serving pawn was Skurge The Executioner. Skurge was madly in love with Amora, who granted him just enough affection to ensure his loyalty. The two pursued many schemes together, often coming into conflict with the thunder god Thor and his mortal comrades, the Avengers. When Skurge eventually sacrificed his life aiding Thor in an heroic rescue mission, Amora mourned him with a genuine grief that surprised everyone, including the Enchantress herself. |||| |||| Other smitten pawns such as the original Power Man (Erik Josten) and a new, human Executioner (Brute Benhurst) never served the Enchantress quite so well as Skurge, and were soon abandoned. Pardoned in recent years after helping defend Asgard against Surtur, Amora has had an on-and-off romantic link with her longtime foe Thor, to whom she was drawn even more strongly after he inherited the throne of Asgard. As Thor's ally, advisor and sometime lover, Amora has been a prominent figure in Thor's Asgard. Sadly, Amora was among the many Asgardians apparently slain when Thor's brother Loki led a revolt in fulfillment of the Ragnarok prophecies. Whether she will rise again remains to be seen."

13245,Moon Maiden,Laura Klein ,13245_20070630201910_char.jpg,"Moon Maiden is able to manipulate the alchemical processes of the Hundred's Lunar Villa, and as such is able to manipulate gravity. The effects range from moving small items around, to flight, to creating havoc with the earth's tides and earthquakes. She can also induce an effect called 'Lunar Madness' in others, which can manifest as anything from traumatic flashbacks to being driven permanently insane.",,"Hugh Klein was an American Astronaut on Apollo XXV, the last manned Moon mission. While on the Moon, Hugh discovered an ancient structure, thereafter referred to as the 'Lunar Villa'. Inside, Hugh finds an infant girl in a cradle, and is then confronted by a ghostly consortium identified as The Hundred. Caelius, speaker for the Hundred, explained how they were a group of scholars and philosophers devoted to peace who fled Rome during the time of the emperors. Using alchemical processes, they created the Lunar Villa and attempted to create a champion of their peaceful ideas on Earth. Unfortunately, they accidentally created the villain known as the Centurion instead. To atone for this mistake, and to perpetuate their beliefs, they created a child they called the Praemonstra Supra, meaning 'She Who Will Point the Way'. Hugh returned to Earth with the infant child, and he and his new wife, Jenny, were allowed to adopt and raise the infant, whom they named Laura. |||| |||| Although Laura exhibited no outward super powers, she was always a brilliant and athletic child. When Laura turned 16, her powers of gravity control manifested. Hugh and Jenny explained Laura's origins to her, and she and Hugh travelled to the Lunar Villa, where the ghostly remains of the Hundred explained her origin and their purpose to them. At this point Laura embarked on her career as Laurel, the Moon Maiden. |||| |||| She soon made many friends among the superhero community, was an early member of the Justice League, and shared at least one adventure with the Teen Titans. Throughout this time, her most frequent opponent was the Centurion. |||| Moon Maiden with the Justice League, Illustrated by Dale Eaglesham. |||| Moon Maiden with the Justice League, Illustrated by Dale Eaglesham. |||| |||| During one of the Centurion's most grandiose schemes, he used a device called an Erasure Weapon, which was capable of erasing a being from history. After erasing several notable heroes from existence, Moon Maiden, along with the remaining members of the Justice League, the Teen Titans, and Infinity Inc. took the battle to the Centurion, in what was known as 'The Century War'. In an act of self-sacrifice, Moon Maiden, took herself and the Centurion high into the sky, and there destroyed his weapon, causing a great explosion, and removing the two of them from history. Only Hugh Klein was able to recall his daughter and the events that had occurred. |||| |||| Moon Maiden eventually returned, wrapped up in the schemes of the also returned Centurion. Hugh was able to rekindle the memories of Laura's friends in the Justice League, and together they were able to free her from the Centurion and she was able to bring a close to his scheme. Afterwards, she felt somewhat lost, as most of the world still was unaware of her, but she had Hugh and her friends to help her rediscover this Earth which was now new to her."
4964,Shark (DC)(02 - Green Lantern villain),,4964_20130415034417_char.jpg,Various mental powers,,"Years ago, the radiation of an atomic pile transformed a tiger shark into a humanoid shark creature with vast mental powers. The powerful but bloodthirsty being became a threat to humanity, battling Green Lantern Hal Jordan, Superman, the JLA, and others over the years. In disguise of an Atlantean called Karshon, he usurped the throne of Poseidonis before being defeated by Aquaman. During the so-called Crisis, Guy Gardner recruited the Shark and other villains to fight the armies of Qward. However, the Shark soon returned to his villainous ways, fighting Jordan, Black Condor (II), and Aquaman again. When last seen, the Shark had once again devolved into a normal tiger shark, due to the telepathic powers of Aquaman."
210,Wonder Woman (DC)(Post Crisis)(03 - Hippolyta),"Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons ",210_20060623234639_char.jpg,,,"Queen of the Amazons, the late 20th-century version of Diana's mother has been a much bigger part of the Wonder Woman back-story than just the worried mother sending her only daughter off to the 'world of men'.  In this version, her political role as Queen of the Amazons has been shown in greater detail, replete with battlefield leadership, questionable politics, and surprising twists. In an effort to make sense of JSA continuity in the post-CRISIS DCU, most of Diana's Golden Age appearances have been retconned to have happened to Hippolyta. Indeed, this version donned the Wonder Woman outfit more than a few times -- and paid the political price at home for doing so. The 'retconned Golden Age Wonder Woman' was far from an abstraction; she appeared as Wonder Woman early in the 1999 run of JSA - and other places - in wholly new adventures. Unfortunately, though, she is currently dead. Thanks to her theoretically long stint as Wonder Woman, however, stories set in most years of the 20th century would likely see Hippolyta return to comics as Wonder Woman. Use this character if the story in question explicitly refers to Hippolyta as the one wearing the bracelets. Wonder Woman's history is so confusing post- Crisis that the only way to reliably navigate is to use the character actually present in the issue, rather than the one that 'probably was wearing the suit, given the events of Crisis '."
665,Wizard (Marvel),Bentley Wittman ,665_20070318193819_char.jpg,"Wittman is a scientific genius, particularly in the fields of applied physics and sub-atomic particles. His Anti-Gravity Discs can lift several hundred pounds each, and can be remotely controlled via relays in his armor. His gauntlets (alternatively referred to as Power Gloves or Wonder Gloves) can unleash potent electrical blasts or use directed gravitational fields to increase his strength. His armor provides him with protection from assault, and devices in his helmet allow him to control the minds of others. |||| |||| The strength he can gain from his Wonder Gloves is unknown. Suffice to say, when he constructed one for Imus Champion in an appropriate size, the villain was able to hurt both Thor and Hyperion in battle.",,"Bentley Wittman grew up possessing near-superhuman levels of genius and, as an adult, became an inventor of great renown, selling his futuristic inventions to the wealthy and becoming quite rich. He became known as the Wizard by legally assuming this stage name and using his advanced scientific inventions to perform feats of 'magic.' |||| |||| Intellectually bored, however, he decided to defeat Johnny Storm, who had just appeared to the world as the Human Torch. Pretending to be a victim, he was rescued by the Torch and invited him to his high-tech, futuristic mansion on Long Island where he captured the Torch with ease. The Wizard then impersonated the Torch, launching a crime spree to destroy the Torch’s reputation, before being captured by the Fantastic Four and sent to prison. |||| |||| The Wizard clashed many more times with the Human Torch until the conclusion of one encounter sent him flying uncontrollably upward by one of his anti-gravity discs, unable to descend safely. He was rescued by two other adversaries of the Torch: the Sandman and Paste-Pot Pete (soon after, the Trapster). After he suggested they team up, a suggestion by the Trapster inspired him to form a team that would be a criminal counterpart to the Fantastic Four, with himself, his two rescuers, and Medusa, who was then suffering from amnesia; becoming the Frightful Four. |||| |||| The Frightful Four proved to be one of the most formidable menaces that the Fantastic Four had yet encountered. The Frightful Four raided the Fantastic Four's Baxter Building headquarters, and affixed the Wizard's anti-gravity discs to the four - minus Johnny, but with Alicia Masters, who managed to alert the Torch with the Invisible Girl's flare gun. Johnny soon appeared and forced the Wizard to use his anti-grav ship to free his team members before they floated into airless space. Then, together they beat the Frightful Four until the Wizard and the Sandman exploded the Wizard's ship as a distraction, and escaped. Later, kidnapping the Invisible Girl, they lured the Fantastic Four to a Pacific atoll where they rigged an experimental 'Q-bomb' to detonate. The Fantastic Four narrowly escaped. Weeks later, the Frightful Four made their third attempt. Capturing the Thing, the Wizard used his 'Id Machine' to simulate the Thing's natural tendencies toward violence and brainwash him into obeying the Wizard's commands. The Fantastic Four finally managed to subdue the Frightful Four, then all but Medusa were turned over to the authorities. |||| |||| In his continued quest to crush the Fantastic Four, the Wizard has tried many iterations of the Frightful Four. He twice brought Medusa back into the ranks, but, as she was no longer a criminal, having since regained her memories, she betrayed them both times. He also never succeeded in finding a permanent replacement for her. His first choice, Thundra, also ended up allying herself with the Fantastic Four as Medusa did. Others who joined the team for a time included Electro, Llyra, and the Brute (Reed Richards of the original Counter-Earth). When the Sandman appeared to give up his life of crime, the Wizard formed a new team with Hydro-Man, Klaw, and Titania. But however formidable, the Frightful Four have always been thwarted by their heroic counterparts. |||| |||| Very rarely has the Wizard operated outside of the Frightful Four. Once, he formed a partnership with Mysterio, but was foiled by Spider-Man. Another time, he teamed up with the Plantman to escape prison and ran into a conflict with the Avengers. He was later broken out of prison by Loki to join the inner circle of villains organizing the Acts of Vengeance against the Avengers, but they were sorely defeated. Often avoiding the limelight that he once embraced, the Wizard hoped to hide from authorities using his former name Bentley Wittman. He was found by the Thunderbolts, however, who convinced the Wizard to provide anti-gravity discs in order for them to battle Graviton and, later, to attach to the Magneto Protocol Satellites. Later still, when the Sandman had appeared to reform his criminal ways, the Wizard took it upon himself to subject his former ally to his id machine, re-integrating the Sandman’s mind and restoring him to villainy. |||| |||| Finally, when the Fantastic Four’s popularity reached an all-time low, the Wizard decided it was time to re-form the Frightful Four once more. No longer motivated by petty jealousy, the Wizard believed the Fantastic Four to be the source of all his troubles, his fall from grace. He rescued the Trapster from the Negative Zone, boosted the powers of Hydro-Man, and called upon his ex-wife, Salamandra, to round out the Frightful Four. He also manipulated Cole, his and Salamandra’s daughter, to develop a relationship with the Human Torch in order to teleport to her and bypass the Fantastic Four’s defenses. During the resulting battle, the Wizard turned on the Trapster, revealing that he intended Cole to be the next member of the Frightful Four. When the Frightful Four defeated the heroes, the Wizard flaunted his success on television and left them humiliated. However, when the Wizard admitted that he only wanted to include Cole once he saw her exhibit superhuman powers, she turned on him. She sought out the Fantastic Four to lead them back to her father and to try to find a cure for her powers. The Wizard and Cole confronted each other, and Cole used one of the Trapster’s traps to ensnare her father, then used her powers over gravity to bring the Wizard’s lair down around him. |||| |||| He has since returned, alive and well, in Fantastic Four #546, with a Frightful FIVE ( Titania, Trapster, Hydro-Man, and Klaw)."

During her time as ruling Shi'ar Majestrix, Deathbird had come to despise the responsibilities of maintaining the needs of an Empire as large as the Shi'ar's. |||| |||| During the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires, Earthquake was amongst a small contingent of the Imperial Guard that defended their Empress Lilandra against the Kree super-team known as Starforce. |||| |||| When the Empress Lilandra learned of the many Earth heroes that had sacrificed their lives to stop the malevolent psionic being named Onslaught, she dispatched eight members of the Imperial Guard, including Earthquake, to protect Earth.

However, this plot was stopped by the Guard, but not before the reactor was used by the Kree's leader, the Supreme Intelligence, to re-incorporate itself after being presumably killed at the end of the war. |||| |||| Subsequently, Earthquake was amongst those Imperial Guard members who defended Lilandra against an assassination attempt by the Kree Ronan the Accuser and his unwilling agents, the royal family of the Earth race known as the Inhumans. ||||"

148,Annihilus (Marvel),Annihilus ,148_20051203110334_char.jpg,"Annihilus is capable of self propelled flight. He can withstand the vacuum of space. He wears armor that grants him resistance to most forms of injury (extreme temperatures, ballistic force, bullets, etc.) His armor is actually an insectoid exoskeleton with some armor components. He is superhumanly strong; the upward limit of what he can lift is just under 50 tons. |||| |||| Annihilus wields the Cosmic Control Rod, a weapon of great power. It allows him to manipulate cosmic energy in order to manipulate the molecular structure of matter. The rod is capable of projecting destructive energy of up to 10 megatons of TNT. Continuous exposure to the cosmic energies of the rod has also retarded the aging process of its wielder. |||| |||| Though Annihilus has knowledge of technology centuries beyond what is known on Earth, his intelligence is only above average compared to normal humans; he is not an original thinker. |||| Retrieved from 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilus' |||| |||| Category: Fantastic Four villains",,"Annihilus is an opponent of the Fantastic Four, who lives in the Negative Zone (another dimension) where he is monarch. Annihilus is an enemy of Blastaar, another enemy of the Fantastic Four. He is a member of an insectoid race and possesses alien technology far in advance to what is encountered on Earth. He is armed with a unique and powerful weapon, the Cosmic Control Rod. Mister Fantastic once travelled to the Negative Zone and took the Cosmic Control Rod to save the life of his unborn son, Franklin Richards. |||| |||| Annihilus has survived certain death on numerous occasions; while his body has been destroyed, he has been reborn again from within his original body into a smaller weaker state, one which quickly grows into his former self, complete with a new cosmic control rod. |||| |||| On another trip to the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Annihilus was again killed, this time by Hellscout, a member of a group of pilgrims who had been sent to the Negative Zone on their crossing to America from England. The pilgrims had him confused for a demon because of his appearance. He was in an extremely weakened state and appeared to be near the end of his life when this occurred. Annihilus reappeared in the 2005 comics mini-series Fantastic Four: Foes with a duplicate who he was fighting for control of the Negative Zone. |||| |||| In the Blink limited series, Annihilus became involved in a brief romantic relationship with the Age of Apocalypse version of Blink. This was presumably the Age of Apocalypse Annihilus from an alternate dimension. |||| |||| The conflict between the two Annihilus spawn, however, seems to have been resolved, as it appears one of them- the other presumably deceased- is now leading the Annihilation Wave, an enormous fleet of Negative Zone battleships, ostensibly claimed to have the goal of conquering the universe. He claims that the universe is expanding into areas of the Negative Zone, making the universe now rightfully his territory. His forces have already destroyed the Kyln, an intergalactic power station and maximum security prison, and the planet Xandar, headquarters of the Nova Corps. He has since gained the aid of Thanos, and two beings that were trapped in the Kyln by Galactus, Tenebrous and Aegis. Tenebrous and Aegis then managed to defeat Galactus and the Silver Surfer, and the two are connected to a giant mechanism in Thanos' starship. It has now been revealed that Annihilus' goal is actually creating a massive Power Cosmic bomb with which to destroy the Universe and the Negative zone, leaving Annihilus the only survivor. Drax, however, with the help of the Silver Surfer, manages to free Galactus, who then nearly annihilates the Annihilation Wave, with Galactus, The Silver Surfer, Nova, Phyla-Vell, and Star-Lord, and the surviving Annihilus the only beings still alive in the area. Nova then has a final battle against Annihilus, in which Phyla manages to steal away the Quantum Bands, and Nova then finally kills Annihilus, by shoving his fist down his throat and ripping out his internal organs. |||| |||| In the epilogue, however, Annihilus' surviving general of his armies, Ravenous, is seen taking a newborn egg for one of the last surviving queen insects, and holding a fetal looking bug in it, proclaiming 'THE LORD ANNIHILUS LIVES!' |||| |||| He also leads an elite personal guard, The Centurions, 100 super-powered aliens, each from a different Negative Zone world. They are extremely loyal to him and form a devastatingly effective army."

He possesses vast superhuman strength and a high degree of invulnerability with some resistance to cold, heat, fire, corrosives and toxins. (When the Wrecking Crew believed their enchantment was fading, they sought augmentation by geneticist Arnim Zola, who used scientific means to restore their power.)",,"Henry Camp was a U.S. Army master sergeant who turned to crime after being discharged. While in prison at Ryker’s Island, he met and befriended Dirk Garthwaite, a.k.a. the Wrecker. The Wrecker told his friends of the power he received by Karnilla, the Norn Queen, power enough to take on the thunder god Thor, and they orchestrated an escape. With fellow convicts Dr. Eliot Franklin and Brian Calusky, the four managed to retrieve the crowbar that housed the powers that had been drained from the Wrecker. Grasping the bar in an electrical storm, the Wrecker was restored, Franklin became Thunderball, Calusky became Piledriver, and Camp became Bulldozer. Together, they became known as the Wrecking Crew. |||| After their first foray against the Defenders, Bulldozer and the Wrecking Crew were inseparable, appearing with them in all their endeavors, including their abduction to Battleworld by the Beyonder and joining with Doctor Doom's army of super-villains. The Crew also joined Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil and Bulldozer was instrumental in helping bring down Hercules. After this, Thor used his hammer to draw the Wrecker’s power away from the others who divided it, and Bulldozer was left powerless. |||| |||| Months later, the Wrecker freed his Crew and restored their power once more. As before, wherever the Wrecking Crew was to be found, Bulldozer was among their number. They performed many other acts of villainy, although they had to deal often with the treachery of Thunderball, who craved the Wrecker’s power all for himself. Eventually, the Crew reconciled, seeking out Hercules once more. But battling them helped Hercules overcome the fear of combat he had suffered since the beating at their hands, and they were defeated. |||| |||| Once, their powers began fading when many of Asgard's links to Earth were separated.

54,Impulse (DC)(01 - Bart Allen),Bartholomew 'Bart' Allen ,54_20080519193410_char.jpg,,,"Suffering from a hyper-accelerated metabolism, Bart Allen was aging at a faster rate than that of any human being thus causing him to appear the age of twelve when he was chronologically only two years old. To prevent him from developing mental health problems he was raised in a virtual reality machine which created a simulated world that kept pace with his own scale of time. When it became clear that this method was not helping, his grandmother, Iris Allen, took him back in time to the present where The Flash, Wally West, tracked him down in a race across the world. By forcing Bart into an extreme burst of speed, Wally managed to shock his hyper-metabolism back to normal. Because he had spent the majority of his childhood in a simulated world, Bart had no concept of danger and was prone to leaping before he looked. The youth proved to be more trouble than Wally could handle, and he was palmed off onto retired superhero speedster Max Mercury, who moved Bart to Manchester, Alabama. As retconned in Impulse #50, Batman named him 'Impulse' as a warning, not as a compliment. |||| |||| Bart joined the Titans early in his career before going on to become one of the founding members (along with Robin and Superboy) of the superhero team Young Justice. For a time, Impulse became the owner of a spaceship granted to him by a rich sultan in appreciation for having helped save his castle. The team used this ship to reunite Doiby Dickles with his queen and restore the rightful rule of Myrg. Impulse stayed with Young Justice for an extensive period of time during which he developed the ability to make speed-force energy duplicates. This allowed him to be in multiple places at once. The newly acquired power proved useful until one of the duplicates was killed during the 'Our Worlds at War' storyline when half the team was lost on Apokolips. Bart quit Young Justice temporarily as the death of his duplicate led him to come to terms with his own mortality. |||| |||| Following Max Mercury's disappearance, Bart was taken in by Jay Garrick, the first Flash, and his wife Joan. After the breakup of Young Justice, Bart joined some of his former teammates in a new line-up of the Teen Titans."
1805,Baron Zemo (Marvel)(02 - Helmut Zemo),Helmut Zemo ,1805_20060309183927_char.jpg,"Zemo's aging has been slowed by periodic immersion in Compound X. |||| |||| He is a gifted scientist. Though not an inventive genius, he is a capable engineer and a talented problem-solver, highly adept at understanding, modifying, and manipulating existing technologies. He is a fine marksman with handguns and an expert swordsman. |||| |||| He sometimes wears circuitry in his hood guarding against psychic assault, and occasionally uses weapons or traps incorporating his father's Adhesive X, which forms an unbreakable bond with any substance unless it is subjected to a special solvent. Zemo has recently usurped Karla Sofen's moonstones, alien power gems which enable him to manipulate energy on a massive scale for effects such as strength/durability augmentation, space warp creation, gravity manipulation, light manipulation, molecular phasing, and more.",,"Helmut Zemo was born to greatness-and great darkness. Both legacies began with Harbin Zemo, a minor official in the small town of Zeulniz who single-handedly fought off a band of Slav raiders in 1480. Rewarded with a title as the first Baron Zemo, Harbin became legendary for his bravery, but he also became infamous for his grandiose ego and bloodthirsty temper. In the early 20th Century, scientific genius Heinrich Zemo became the twelfth Baron Zemo. Heinrich and his wife Hilda had a son, Helmut. Born in the 1930s, Helmut spent at least part of his youth in Berlin, developing a fondness for American popular culture imports such as horror films, comic books and movie serials. |||| |||| |||| Meanwhile, Heinrich became a leading scientist and special agent in Hitler's Nazi regime, inventing an early laser beam (his 'death ray'), the super-durable Adhesive X, the age-retarding Compound X, and more. While his loving family worshipped him, Heinrich quickly became one of the most despised enemies of the Allied powers, and was also widely disgraced in his own country after a defeat by America's Howling Commandos. Hated and feared both at home and abroad, Heinrich began wearing a hooded disguise almost constantly; he also began going mad, especially after his hood was permanently glued to his head by Adhesive X during a battle with the Allied super-agent Captain America. As Heinrich grew more unstable, he became abusive toward his family. Hilda died helping Captain America thwart Zemo's Medusa Effect scheme, but Helmut remained loyal, helping his father battle the Captain and the hero's young partner Bucky Barnes during that same incident. |||| |||| In 1945, Baron Zemo seemingly slew Captain America and Bucky and went into hiding in the Amazon, carving out his own private kingdom with the aid of a mercenary army (including Erik Josten in recent years) and an enslaved native population. In Heinrich's absence, Helmut led a more normal life for decades, studying science and becoming an engineer. Summoned to visit Heinrich's Amazon stronghold, Helmut watched his father ruthlessly crush a native uprising, saw Josten's fanatical devotion to the Baron, and heard Heinrich boast of killing the World War II freedom fighter Citizen V (John Watkins); Helmut was disturbed yet intrigued. Roughly one year later, news of Captain America's survival led to a series of clashes between the Captain (backed by the Avengers) and the Baron (backed by his Masters of Evil). After Heinrich accidentally killed himself during a battle with Captain America, Helmut blamed the Captain for destroying their family. Studying and replicating some of Heinrich's inventions and undergoing combat training, Helmut eventually attacked Captain America in the costumed guise of the Phoenix, also battling the Captain's new partner the Falcon. In the end, Zemo was accidentally knocked into a vat of Adhesive X. |||| |||| Helmut survived, but with hideous facial scars. As the new Baron Zemo, he targeted Captain America with the aid of his android ally Primus and various mutates created by Zemo's mad geneticist associate Arnim Zola, such as the rat-man Vermin. Zemo also began menacing the Captain's friends, notably Arnie Roth. Barely escaping with his life after Vermin turned on him, Zemo formed an alliance with Nazi mastermind the Red Skull and his daughter Mother Night, allowing them to mentor him in the ways of evil as they launched a series of attacks on Captain America and his friends. Zemo soon wearied of both his subordinate status and his mentors' indiscriminately hateful worldview, so he turned against his allies. Narrowly surviving a psychic assault from Mother Night, the Baron decided to avenge the loss of his family by destroying Captain America's adopted family, the Avengers. Zemo recruited the largest Masters of Evil team yet and led them in occupying Avengers Mansion, capturing and torturing several of the occupants. The Avengers soon retook the Mansion, and Zemo suffered a crippling fall in battle with Captain America. |||| |||| Later, aided by the mercenary Batroc's Brigade, Zemo battled Captain America and others on a futile quest to resurrect Heinrich with the Bloodstone. Further injured in another fall while escaping, Zemo subsequently tried to press Vermin and the other mutates back into his service, but Spider-Man opposed him, and Vermin ultimately turned on him viciously again. Sometime thereafter, Helmut married the Zemo-inspired terrorist known as the Baroness, who had once claimed to be Heinrich Zemo resurrected in female form. As the Baron and Baroness Zemo, the couple abducted a host of neglected and abused children to create an instant family for themselves, but Captain America freed the children and captured the Zemos with the aid of Diamondback (Rachel Leighton) and Free Spirit. |||| |||| After Heike reportedly died in prison, Zemo had begun to reassemble his Masters when the Avengers (including Captain America) were seemingly slain by Onslaught. Deprived of his greatest foes and his guiding obsession, Zemo finally began to accept the fact that his father had destroyed himself, and that his own obsession with destroying Captain America was ultimately pointless. Shifting his focus from vengeance to power, Zemo led his Masters in masquerading as the Thunderbolts, a new heroic super-team replacing the Avengers, accumulating public trust and resources until they were ready to strike. Zemo himself posed as the new Citizen V in a mockingly ironic nod to Heinrich's old victim. The deception lasted for months, until Zemo used a mind-influencing bio-modem to subjugate much of the planet. Most of the Thunderbolts had grown to like their roles as heroes, though, so they turned against Zemo and foiled his plot, despite his use of the Avengers and the Fantastic Four as mind-controlled pawns. Savagely beaten by his teammate Moonstone (Karla Sofen), who resented Zemo for squandering the potential of their heroic pose, Helmut escaped with the reluctant aid of Thunderbolts member Atlas (Erik Josten), paying his debt to the Zemo family). |||| |||| Partnered for a time with the robotic Techno, Zemo repeatedly sought revenge on the Thunderbolts. However, he gradually realized that Moonstone was right about his having wasted the group's early potential, and decided it might be better to manipulate the world rather than openly rule it. Stalked by the new Citizen V (Dallas Riordan), who sought to destroy him for tainting the Citizen V legacy, Zemo escaped her but was later killed in his own headquarters by the government assassin Scourge (Jack Monroe). |||| |||| However, Zemo's consciousness survived thanks to a failsafe device engineered by Techno, transplanting Zemo's consciousness into the comatose body of adventurer John Watkins III, the previous Citizen V (true heir to the original). Posing as a revived Citizen V, Zemo reluctantly served the V-Battalion, helping to foil Baron Strucker's mind control conspiracy (of which Scourge had been an unwilling agent). When Strucker's daughter Andrea realized who Citizen V really was, Zemo slew her. For a time, Citizen V led a government-sponsored team of super-agents known as the Redeemers. When Graviton slaughtered the Redeemers, Citizen V teamed with the Thunderbolts to save the world from Graviton, though the battle hurled almost all the Thunderbolts into the Franklin Richards-created Counter-Earth. Zemo's disembodied consciousness went with them, now inhabiting the tech-pack of Fixer (Techno reborn in his original human form), then usurped the body of Counter-Earth’s Helmut Zemo with the Fixer's aid. |||| |||| Reborn in an unscarred facsimile of his original body, Zemo at first hoped to conquer Counter-Earth, but reluctantly joined the team's efforts to save the world rather than rule it, slowly coming to regard the business of world-saving as an intriguing and rewarding challenge. Already influenced by his stints with the Thunderbolts and the Redeemers, as well as his time within the brain of John Watkins III, Zemo had begun to show tiny sparks of nobility. He and the other Thunderbolts were soon regarded as beloved heroes by the people of Counter-Earth. |||| |||| Zemo's Thunderbolts were thrown back to their native Earth while saving both worlds from an all-consuming void. They accomplished this with the aid of a new team of Thunderbolts that Hawkeye and Songbird had organized on Earth in their absence, and the two factions of Thunderbolts soon assembled to decide their collective future. Though deeply suspicious of Zemo, Hawkeye was soon convinced that Zemo at least had the desire and potential to reform, and Hawkeye believed he could trust the other Thunderbolts to keep an eye on him. With this in mind, Hawkeye and several others left the group, and the remaining Thunderbolts reorganized under Zemo's leadership. Zemo even began to develop a romantic interest in Moonstone, though whether it was ever mutual is unclear. |||| Zemo's new Thunderbolts soon became internationally celebrated heroes. However, none of the team fully trusted Zemo, and the Avengers regarded him with even greater suspicion, planting Tony Stark in the Cobalt Man suit as a spy within his group. When the Thunderbolts created the global energy-absorbing Liberator project, the Avengers uncovered evidence of a secret failsafe designed to steal its power, and assumed it was Zemo's handiwork. However, when the Avengers interfered in the Liberator's test run, the failsafe turned out to be created by Moonstone. He accidentally absorbed the Liberator energies and went on a power-mad rampage stopped by the combined efforts of both teams, though not before Zemo's face had been horribly scarred again - ironically, while shielding Captain America from Moonstone. In the end, Zemo's Thunderbolts broke up, Moonstone was left comatose, and Zemo absconded with Moonstone's vastly powerful alien gemstones. He has since worked behind the scenes to manipulate the new Thunderbolts without their knowledge, pursuing goals as yet unknown."

473,Night Thrasher (Marvel)(01 - Dwayne Taylor),Dwayne Taylor ,473_20050925140753_char.jpg,,,"Dwayne Taylor grew up believing his rich parents were killed by criminals for some unexplained reason. Taylor's guardians, the ex-military sergeant Chord (a friend of his father's) and the elderly martial arts master Tai, supported Taylor's vow to make all criminals pay for their actions, helping him create the identity of Night Thrasher. |||| |||| Taylor trained hard to be a skilled fighter. On his first outing, he met Midnight's Fire and Silhouette. These two superhumans were taking out criminals by gaining their confidence and then busting them. Giving his name as Night Thrasher, Taylor joined them on their crusade. One night, while Silhouette was infiltrating a gunrunning operation, the police accidentally came upon them. Scared that the police were fixing to shoot his sister, Midnight's Fire started to throw a blade at them. Taylor stopped him before he had a chance to throw it, and a gun battle erupted. Silhouette was hit and badly injured in the spine. Taylor, who had fallen in love with Silhouette, was heartbroken, as was Midnight's Fire. Midnight's Fire swore to get revenge on Taylor someday. Taylor left them, believing that Silhouette was dead. |||| |||| Realizing that he needed more of an edge, Taylor trained even harder. Using his parent's Taylor Foundation, Taylor had Chord provide him with a state-of-the-art headquarters, training facilities, and computer support systems. He also had developed specialized armor and weaponry. Taylor then decided to create a special team so he would have some backup. He recruited several young heroes and formed the New Warriors. |||| |||| Shortly after they formed the team, Midnight's Fire made an appearance and tried to frame Taylor with the murder of two policemen. In a final battle with Midnight's Fire, Taylor overcame his fear of his nemesis and beat him in a battle. Taylor then discovered that Silhouette was still alive but crippled. She renounced her brother's actions, turning him in to the police and joining Taylor in the New Warriors. |||| |||| After the Warriors thwarted a plot by the criminal scientists of A.I.M., Taylor discovered a link between A.I.M.'s benefactors and the Taylor Foundation. With some investigation, he discovered dozens of illegal operations and shady business practices performed by the Foundation, linking them with criminal industrialist Gideon and the Japanese Yakuza syndicate, among others. Taylor used the Warriors to seek out the truth in confronting the Yakuza, but the team balked at making a deal with criminals. Taylor refused to budge, and the argument led him to quit the New Warriors. |||| |||| Taylor was then approached by the criminal team Folding Circle, of which Midnight's Fire was a part, since they promised to lead him to the truth of his past. In doing so, it was revealed that Taylor's father, while in Vietnam, was captured by Tai, who was a powerful sorcerer guarding an ancient temple. Tai had coerced Taylor's father and others in his military unit, including Chord, to have children with the women of the temple, in order that their children would later be sacrificed in the temple's mystic well of dimensional energies and thereby give Tai even greater power. Chord and Taylor's father tried to thwart this plot, and Chord was thus mystically ensorcelled to kill Taylor's parents. The Folding Circle was comprised of the children of Tai's prophecy, but it was assembling its members too early for Tai's wishes. The New Warriors, investigating Night Thrasher's activities, tracked the Circle to the Vietnamese temple, where they joined Folding Circle in a climatic battle with Tai. Ultimately, Tai was seemingly slain by the very energies she tried to master. |||| |||| Taylor rejoined the New Warriors and served with them for a long tenure. He left the team eventually, rededicating himself to his role as chairman of the Taylor Foundation, although he would team up with them when the need arose. Later, Taylor decided to give up adventuring altogether, becoming a full-time director of the Taylor Foundation. He believed that true battles for justice would be fought in the boardrooms. He moved to the Seattle branch of the Foundation, seemingly disbanding the New Warriors. |||| |||| Over time, however, the New Warriors reassembled without Taylor's help. Even so, as the Warriors continued to use equipment and facilities associated with the Taylor Foundation, he was able to monitor the new version of the team. He even rejoined them briefly against the assassin Junzo Muto and agents of the Hand. |||| |||| More recently, the Taylor Foundation suffered a massive downfall when its funding of cancer research banked on the efforts of Zachary Smith. Smith’s cure was revealed to be nothing more than his mutant son’s subconscious help. The Foundation’s stock tanked and Smith abandoned his son, but Dwayne Taylor stepped in to adopt the young mutant, now Microbe. However, it would require more creative solutions to save the Foundation. Night Thrasher made a deal with shady television executive Ashley Brothers to avoid bankruptcy, but this also forced the New Warriors into a unique re-branding as a reality-TV show. Hoping to make the best of the situation, the team hit the road to become heroes for the common man throughout small-town America. |||| |||| The Warriors enjoyed mixed success and popularity, but the show was officially cancelled and bankruptcy proceedings were initiated. Even so, the Warriors were able to return and continue their reality-TV efforts. However, when they hoped to boost their ratings by apprehending a quartet of villains holed up in Stamford, Connecticut, tragedy struck. During the battle, Nitro used his power to cause a massive explosion. It killed Night Thrasher, the New Warriors, and almost everyone in the vicinity."
1552,Star-Spangled Kid (DC)(01 - Sylvester Pemberton),Sylvester Pemberton ,1552_20070121203604_char.jpg,"No meta-human powers.  Excellent physical conditioning and hand-to-hand fighting skills.  First adventured solely on these skills along.  After a time, however, he started to use a semi-retired Starman's cosmic rod.  Later, he employed the 'cosmic converter belt', which had the same basic functionality of the rod.  Still later, the belt was depowered, allowing him only to fly.","He's just a guy in a suit, at the end of the day.","When someone at Pat Dugan's auto-repair shop mentioned that they wished the American flag could come to life on the battlefield and kick some Nazi ass, Sylvester Pemberton got an idea.  Having gained some confidence in hand-to-hand combat with Nazi agents at a local movie theatre, he decided to make a costume that resembled the American flag, and begin a double life as a 'man of mystery'. |||| |||| He teamed with a reluctant Dugan, who had taken the name 'Stripesy' and had already begun adventuring on his own.  (Like Pemberton, Dugan has been inspired by the comments of the man in his auto repair shop.)  This partnership that would rarely be seen separately.  Oddly, the Kid was the lead hero, and Stripesy, his sidekick--despite the fact that Pemberton was very much younger than Dugan.  This was perhaps for classist reasons:  Pemberton was from a very wealthy family and Dugan was 'just' a mechanic.  Indeed, when not in uniform, Dugan became the Pemberton family chauffeur. Pemberton seemingly spent all of his career looking for a home among other superheroes.  He initially went with the the All-Star Squadron, then the JSA, then the original Seven Soldiers of Victory, then formed Infinity, Inc. |||| |||| His exact time line is open to some debate, however, as it appears different when viewed by publication date rather than by the internal DCU calendar. |||| |||| Moreover, his own personal chronology is significantly muddled by the fact that, as a member of the Seven Soldiers, he was apparently thrown back in time 50,000 years, then brought back to the 20th century many years after he had left it.  He may have additionally spent some portion of his later life on Earth 1, rather than his native Earth 2. |||| |||| In adulthood, he would become known as 'Skyman'--but that's genuine trivia, as the bulk of his stories occur as the 'Star-Spangled Kid'."

368,Black Adam (DC)(Post Crisis),Teth-Adam ,368_20070317133049_char.jpg,,,"In this revised origin (told in Power of Shazam! #10), Teth-Adam was the son of the ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Rameses II, and impressed one of the high priests, the wizard Shazam, with his good deeds. The wizard had the young prince brought before him, and ordered him to speak his name. Teth-Adam did so, and was transformed into Mighty-Adam, a superhero possessing the stamina of Shu, the swiftness of Heru (Horus), the strength of Amon, the wisdom of Zehuti, the power of Aton, and the courage of Mehen. |||| |||| Mighty-Adam served as Egypt's champion for many centuries, but became corrupted by the charms of a mysterious woman, revealed to be Shazam's evil daughter Blaze in disguise. Bewitched by Blaze, Adam became convinced that he and his mistress should rule the Egyptian kingdom, so he killed the Pharaoh and appointed himself ruler. Shazam was made aware of this treachery and, as a result, unleashed a powerful spell on Adam. The wizard extracted Mighty Adam's magic powers and encased them in a mystical scarab necklace, rendering Adam's de-powered body, now several hundred years old, into a withered corpse. |||| |||| Shazam then buried both the body and the scarab in the tomb of Rameses II, where he had planned for it to remain for all eternity. In death, the former hero was referred to as 'Khem-Adam' ('Black Adam'). Disillusioned by what he perceived as Adam's betrayal, Shazam went several millennia before appointing a second champion to fight evil in his name. |||| |||| The original Power of Shazam! graphic novel (which predated the publication of the series by a year) explained how Black Adam was revived and introduced into the modern world. In this story, an unscrupulous archaeological aide named Theo Adam finds himself assigned to the Malcom Expedition, an archaeological dig financed by the Sivana Foundation to excavate the tomb of Rameses II. Adam uncovers Khem-Adam's tomb in a secret passageway, and leads his superiors, C.C. Batson and his wife Marilyn, to the discovery. Upon first sight of Khem-Adam's scarab, Theo Adam became obsessed with the artifact, and killed both Batsons in order to steal it. Escaping Egypt, Theo Adam soon made his way back to America. |||| |||| The Batsons' son, Billy, had been left behind in the United States, and was soon appointed to become Captain Marvel, the second champion of the wizard Shazam. When Theo Adam first encountered Captain Marvel, he noted both Marvel's identical appearance to C.C. Batson and the lightning-bolt insignia on Marvel's chest that had also decorated Khem-Adam's tomb. Adam therefore had a revelation, and realized that he was a reincarnation of Khem-Adam. Grasping his stolen scarab, Adam spoke the wizard's Shazam's name and was transformed into the super-powered Black Adam. Black Adam revealed himself to Captain Marvel as the Batsons' killer, and the two battled. Captain Marvel emerged victorious by snatching Adam's scarab, and therefore his power, away from him. Marvel brought Theo Adam to Shazam, who wiped Adam's memory and took away his voice, so that he could not access his powers."

However, he needed an element known as Vibranium, which only existed in a small African country known as Wakanda. In order to obtain the needed amount, Klaw hired a group of mercenaries and traveled to Africa in search of it. He found the Wakandan tribe and their leader, T’Chaka, guarding the vibranium, which was part of their sacred mound. Klaw demanded that they give up the mound, but they refused and he ordered his men to kill T’Chaka. They gunned the chief down in front of his young son, T’Challa, who had never before witnessed gunfire. Klaw then used his superior weaponry to massacre the tribesmen and burn down their village. In response, T’Challa stole Klaw’s sound-blaster from one of Klaw’s men and turned it on him, shattering his hand. |||| |||| Incensed by the Wakanda’s retaliation, Klaw returned to the Netherlands and vowed to return one day to exact revenge. To that end he created a sonic gun he called a force glove to replace his hand. Exactly ten years later, Klaw returned to Wakanda to find T’Challa in the guise of the Black Panther; ruling the tribe in his father’s place. With the help of the Fantastic Four and Wyatt Wingfoot, the Wakandans again repulsed Klaw. During the battle, the Panther fought Klaw face-to-face, eventually overloading his machines and left, believing him defeated. |||| |||| In frustration, Klaw leapt into his own sonic converter in the hopes of giving himself the power to defeat his enemies. It worked and Klaw’s being turned to pure, living sound. Klaw later came after the Fantastic Four, trying to force them to bring him the Panther; but after a fight with the group, Mister Fantastic defeated Klaw when he radioed the Panther who sent him vibranium knuckles to absorb Klaw’s power, which Reed used to beat him into unconsciousness. The Thing then crushed his sonic-gun arm to disable him and they handed him over to the authorities. Klaw was freed from prison by the Crimson Cowl and invited to join the second grouping of the Masters of Evil. The new Masters of Evil eventually fought and captured the Avengers, but then were beaten and Klaw was again imprisoned, only to be set free and returned twice more. |||| |||| Later, while traveling to Wakanda to attempt to steal a device that would strengthen the mental-disintegrating powers of Vibranium, Klaw was defeated by the Thing and the Human Torch, as well as the Black Panther. He was also briefly a member of the Frightful Four, invited by the Wizard. Klaw was defeated and thought destroyed many times afterwards, but every time he managed to rematerialize thanks to his body of living sound."

There, she met Screaming Mimi, and told her about her teammates in the Grapplers. After they escaped from prison, they rejoined Poundcakes' teammates Letha and Titania. The group was then contracted by the Roxxon Oil Company, and given special powers by the Power Broker. Poundcakes was given superhuman strength along with her teammates, but also a pair of 'seismatic boots', which gives her the ability to create tremors and minor earthquakes by stomping the ground. |||| |||| One mission joined the Grapplers with Thundra, a powerful female warrior. They were able to convince her to aid them in sabotaging Project Pegasus, but quickly turned on her and ran off to do their own thing. Poundcakes and Titania were confronted by Giant-Man. He was able to grab Titania, but Poundcakes launched him into a fiery pit of acid. He was able to climb back up, only to be attacked by both women. Poundcakes stomped on his foot, shrinking Giant-Man back down to size. Both Poundcakes and Titania grabbed one of Giant-Man's arms, planning to pull his limbs apart. However, using the last of his strength, Giant-Man grabbed the two mercenaries and smashed them together, knocking them out cold. |||| |||| Poundcakes was next seen with her accomplices in prison. After Dazzler is charged for the death of Klaw, the Grapplers kidnap her and attempt to find out how she killed him. Dazzler refuses to answer anything, which causes Poundcakes to beat her. Dazzler tries to stop the large woman from attacking her, but is unable to do anything. However, as soon as Screaming Mimi uses her powers on Dazzler, she is able to absorb the sound and use it against the Grapplers, defeating them. |||| |||| After breaking out of prison with her teammates, Poundcakes and the Grapplers decided to pay a visit to the Thing, who helped put them in prison after their mission against Project Pegasus. However, as soon as they arrived at the hospital where the Thing was, they were suddenly ambushed by Captain America. Poundcakes immediately attacked the super-hero, but he used his shield to protect him from her assault. He was soon able to defeat her by throwing her with his shield, but she and the other Grapplers quickly recovered. Captain America was soon given back-up by the X-Men, who made quick work of the Grapplers. They were later seen alongside a large army of super-villains, including MODOK, Constrictor, Whiplash, and Mole Man, as they banded together in attempt to kill the Thing. |||| |||| Although her teammates Letha and Titania were soon killed by the Scourge of the Underworld, Poundcakes continued her career in villainy. She was approached by Jackhammer, who showed romantic interest in her. She, however, was not interested, and felt enraged that he would flirt with her in public. Fearing for her reputation, she began creating tremors and attacked Jackhammer. Anaconda, aiding her friend Diamondback on her date with Captain America, attacked Poundcakes and Jackhammer. Asp's paralyzing blasts rendered the pair unconscious, and they drove off, dumping their bodies elsewhere. Poundcakes later received an invitation to join Superia's Femizons, which she accepted. Aboard the S.S. Superia, Poundcakes battled Captain America and Paladin, once attempting to tear Paladin's limbs apart alongside Titania, Frenzy, and Pink Pearl.

In the Vertigo series, Madame Xanadu has much of her magical power taken away from her by Merlin. She is shown attempting to get her powers back by various means. Before besting Death and gaining virtual immortality, Madame Xanadu frequently had to drink a potion that rejuvenated her youth. Without it, she would become old and sickly within a matter of weeks.","Nimue Inwudu was the youngest sister of Vivienne (the Lady of the Lake) and Morgana Inwudu. The three grew up as Homo Magi and witnessed the dawn of mankind.  Nimue cared for homo sapiens as she did for all other species, but Morgana liked to toy with them and pull them toward their baser instincts. |||| |||| A bit of Morgana rubbed off on Nimue when she cast a spell of seduction on Merlin, in which she taught him his magic in exchange for sexual favors. Merlin had the last laugh, though, as he succeeded in stripping her magic away from her.  Shortly thereafter, Morgana, now styling herself Morgaine LeFay, conquered Camelot, and Merlin's demon, Etrigan, who was summoned to stop Morgana, was left to wander, as did Nimue, occasionally crossing paths with him. |||| |||| She fled to China and became an adviser in the court of Kublai Khan, trading sexual favors for her passage.  She left him, repulsed that he exiled his beloved Fourth Consort after she was raped. |||| |||| In 1493, sh arrived in Spain and fell in love with a beautiful young lady, Marisol de Rios, who was burned at the stake for sodomy by the Inquisition.  Nimue was not at home at the time of Marisol's capture, and was spared, but turned her back on Spain. |||| |||| She then went to France, where she was dubbed Madame de Xanadu for having come from Kublai Khan's palace.  She was a favorite of Marie Antoinette until a Tarot reading predicting the events of 1789. |||| |||| Denied access to her anti-aging potions while imprisoned in the Bastille, Madame Xanadu received a visit from Death, who was in an especially chipper mood, having just been at a party.  Madame Xanadu so amused Death with a creative interpretation of her own Tarot reading as involving living a long life, that Death declared that she would only take her if Nimue requested it, but left the anti-aging spells up to Nimue. |||| |||| She frequently crossed paths with the Phantom Stranger,.  She nearly fell in love with him, but ultimately found him too unfeeling, particularly after he stated that the French Revolution was an important step toward Kent Nelson's recovery of the Doctor Fate helmet and the necessity of the death of Mary Jane Kelly, who was Xanadu's friend (as were the other victims of Jack the Ripper, although she herself had long since abandoned prostitution), on the grounds that Jason Blood (Etrigan) had impregnanted her with a demonic child. |||| |||| Her desire for revenge on the Phantom Stranger over Mary's death inadvertently led to her causing Jim Corrigan to die and become the Spectre. |||| |||| She wandered for quite some time before deciding that she wanted to atone for her sins. She did so by helping those troubled with the supernatural. She has operated her fortune telling parlour out of Greenwich Village since the late 1930s. |||| |||| She however remained without any real magic might of her own, which has led her to manipulate various forces in order to gain power. |||| |||| Over the centuries Madame Xanadu developed herself as an advisor, and now Xanadu often meets clientele plagued by supernatural problems. Although she can advise them however, some force prevents her from directly interfering in solving their troubles. If one of her clients manages to conquer a supernatural force, she can contain that entity in jars within her fortune parlour to prevent it from causing any further trouble. |||| |||| When the Spectre was punished after his failures during the Crisis on Infinite Earths and the battle in Hell that soon followed, he and Jim Corrigan werre separated into two separate entities.  Madame Xanadu found Corrigan in an urn in a locker in Grand Central terminal and freed him.  She also found him an assistant in Kim Liang.  He then set up shop as a private investigator right above Xanadu's own shop.  She began an intimate relationship with the Spectre (she would undress and breathe him in as mist), although not Corrigan, who was having a chaste romance with Kim Liang."

He is an expert pilot and a marksman with crossbows, guns and throwing knives. |||| |||| His weaponry includes various firearms, a collapsible crossbow, a wrist spike, spring-loaded stiletto blades in his gauntlets, various explosives and poisoned knives.",,"Young Brock Rumlow led the Savage Crims gang on New York's lower east side. After he brutalized fifteen year old Rachel Leighton, two of her brothers assaulted Brock; the eldest brother was killed. Rumlow fled, entering the Taskmaster's school for criminals, and within three years became an instructor there under the name Bingo Brock. As a mercenary, he enlisted with the communist Red Skull (Albert Malik) in Algeria, serving him as 'Frag' until he was sent to invade Arnim Zola's Switzerland chateau. Ultimately the only team member to survive the assault, Rumlow there met and impressed the Nazi Red Skull (Johann Shmidt); this Skull accepted Brock’s services, code-naming him “Crossbones.” |||| |||| Sent to retrieve the five Bloodstone fragments, Crossbones shadowed Helmut Zemo’s search for them. While Zemo battled Captain America, Crossbones knocked out Captain America's pilot, John Jameson, and stole two fragments; when he got near the other three, the five combined to re-animate Heinrich Zemo's corpse under control of the alien Hellfire Helix. Unobserved, Crossbones destroyed the Helix (worn on the corpse's forehead) with a crossbow bolt. Brock then kidnapped Diamondback (whom he recognized as Rachel Leighton), using her as bait to trap Captain America; but when the Skull learned of Crossbones' involvement with the Captain, he ordered Crossbones to flee. Crossbones recruited the Controller and Voice of Doom to serve the Skull, led the Skeleton Crew against the Hellfire Club’s Selene, and, using psychic Tristam Micawber, located the Skull after Magneto kidnapped him. He attempted assassinating the Kingpin, was stopped by Typhoid Mary, and battled Bullseye when the Kingpin retaliated. He led the Skeleton Crew when they were captured by the Schutz-Heiliggruppe (Blitzkrieg, Hauptmann Deutschland, Zeitgeist); after Arnim Zola rescued them, the Skull faked the assassination of himself, Mother Night, and Crossbones. The Red Skull finally fired Crossbones for questioning the Skull's decision to ally with the Viper. |||| Enlarge |||| Crossbones headed east, working briefly in Chicago for druglord Marco Sanzionare against Super Pro. In New York, Crossbones kidnapped and brainwashed Diamondback by abusing her repeatedly and forcing her through a rigid combat training routine. Forcing Diamondback to steal Captain America's super-soldier treated blood from Avengers Mansion, Crossbones returned to the Skull. When the Skeleton Crew's new leader, Cutthroat, plotted Crossbones’ murder, Mother Night warned Brock, who slit Cutthroat's jugular. Diamondback escaped, summoning Captain America and the Falcon to capture the Skull’s operatives; Crossbones was imprisoned, but eventually convinced officials he was rehabilitating, partly by defeating the terrorist cell 'Fortress' when they invaded a Denver hospital. Exploiting his jailors’ gullibility, Crossbones escaped, and was hired by Hydra to bomb New York's embassy row alongside the Absorbing Man, but the pair was stopped by Captain America. Betrayed by Hydra, Crossbones fled, wreaking vengeance on his bosses. He was hired by New Son to assassinate Gambit, but despite allying with Batroc and Zaran, was defeated by the combined efforts of New Orleans' assassin's and thieves’ guilds; Crossbones was imprisoned in the Raft until Electro's break-in freed him. The Skull promptly rehired him, and he was aiding in re-powering a Cosmic Cube when Alexander Lukin’s Winter Soldier assassinated the Red Skull and stole the Cube. Lukin anonymously blamed Captain America for the Skull’s death, but Crossbones soon realized the truth and now appears to be hunting Lukin."

In addition, the uniform has a life support function that can sustain Rider under the most extreme environmental conditions. It can act as a space suit by locking off the mouth and eyes of the helmet. The helmet can also pick up radio transmissions, as well as act as a heads-up display for tracking energy signatures.",,"Chosen at random by the dying Xandarian Rhomann Dey to receive his Nova Corps powers, teenager Richard Rider found himself thrust into the role of superhero, a role he grasped with relish. He battled foes such as Dey's nemesis Zorr, the winged mutant criminal Condor, the amnesiac Powerhouse (actually a Xandarian sent to locate the missing Dey), and the mysterious Sphinx. The latter eventually kidnapped Nova and several others, using Dey's spaceship to transport them all to Xandar. |||| |||| Learning that Xandar was threatened by the Skrull Empire, Nova and his fellows (bar the Sphinx, who had returned to Earth, and Dr. Sun, who teleported to an unknown location) pledged their aid; the Skrulls were eventually driven off with the help of the Galadorian spaceknight Rom. Homesick for Earth, Richard agreed to give up his powers, which were needed to help rebuild war-ravaged Xandar's defenses, and returned home a normal human once more. |||| Enlarge |||| |||| Or so it seemed. Months later Richard was tracked down by Night Thrasher, who believed Richard's powers were merely dormant and wished to recruit Nova for his prospective hero team. To test the theory, Night Thrasher dropped Richard off a roof; luckily for both of them, Night Thrasher was correct, and the adrenaline rush re-awoke Richard's abilities. Alongside several other teenage heroes he founded the New Warriors, and also resumed his solo career. He fought alongside the New Warriors for years, including encounters with Nova's old foe the Sphinx and a brief stint during which the Warriors worked with Cable and X-Force. He was eventually hunted down by Super-Nova, the Xandarian who held the rest of the Nova-Force inside his body and had been driven mad by it. The two of them, aided by the New Warriors and Galactus' Xandarian heralds Firelord and Air-Walker, ended up setting off protocols that led to Xandar's resurrection. The StarCorps was reinstated, and Rider was appointed Centurion Prime and assigned to guard earth's sector of space. |||| |||| Returning to Earth, Rider was confronted with dual lives as Centurion Prime and a member of the New Warriors. He also encountered another Nova from an alternate timeline named Nova 0:0. Nova 0:0 attacked Rider to prepare him for defending his Earth from the force that had destroyed Nova 0:0's Earth, the Deathstorm. After stopping the Deathstorm and saving Earth, Rider was replaced as Centurion Prime for Earth's sector of space by Garthan Saal, the former Super-Nova, after failing to follow orders at a crucial time. |||| |||| When Saal sacrificed himself to save earth from the Dire Wraith queen Volx, he passed his powers back to Rider. He continued to fight alongside the New Warriors until the team broke up, reformed, and broke up again. He agreed to come back as part of the New Warriors reality TV show, and traveled the U.S. with the team, fighting menaces that'd taken up residence in communities that didn't have resident heroes. The team fought several criminals who'd escaped the Raft during the massive prison break that led to the reestablishing of the Avengers, before being recalled to Xandar alongside the rest of the Nova Corps to deal with the threat of the Annihilation Wave. Rider was the only StarCorps member to survive the Wave's surprise attack, and has become the bearer of the entire Nova-Force, as well as the Xandarian Worldmind, the living computers that contain the entire record of Xandarian civilization as well as the minds of all its deceased members. |||| |||| Nova then came into contact with Drax who taught him how to better control the Nova Force and how to kill. Realizing his new leadership abilities, Nova created the United Front, an army opposed to Annihilus. Several beings joined the United Front alongside Nova including Silver Surfer, Ronan, Gamora, Phyla-Vell, Moondragon, the Spaceknights, Blastaar, Stardust, Firelord, Red Shift, Super-Skrull, Star-Lord, and others. Alongside these beings Nova was able to squash Annihilus's forces and kill Annihilus. |||| |||| After the war, Richard started to scan the galaxy, searching for beings who needed help. Continuing this for an undetermined amount of time he became fatigued and homesick. The Worldmind advised Richard to return to Earth to rest. Taking Worldmind's advice Richard returned to Earth to find the state of the world after the Civil War. While back home Richard was approached by Iron Man, who strongly urged Richard to register. Stark then sent Justice to try and convince him to register. Failing to see the point to any of the madness Richard left Earth and returned to his Nova duties. |||| |||| Recently the Phalanx took control of Kree Space and infected many worlds. Finding himself trapped inside Kree Space, Nova crashed into an energy barrier and landed on a Kree outpost severely damaged. There the commander, Ko-Rel took him in and tried to oppose a horde of Phalanx and an infected Gamora. Richard being too weak to fight back, the Worldmind uploaded some of the Nova Force into Ko-Rel turing her into a Nova Corps member. Gamora then slipped past the Kree defenses and infected Richard with the techno-organic virus, turning him into a Phalanx Select. From there Gamora and Rider left the outpost and returned to Hala. |||| |||| Seemingly accepting the transmode virus, Richard alongside Gamora then hunted down and infected Drax with the techno-organic virus. Returning to Hala, Richard was attacked by Ko-Rel who was led by the Worldmind. However, Ko-Rel was not powerful enough to defeat Richard and died at his hands. After returning from the battle, Richard was then taken inside his mind by Worldmind and showed Richard that he was indeed fighting the techno-organic virus. Now boosted with hope and the help of Ko-Rel's returned power, Richard managed to break free of the Phalanx control and escaped from Hala. Richard then created a wormhole and was followed by Drax and Gamora. Once going through the wormhole they were all transported into unknown space. |||| Nova soon found himself at the edge of the universe in a place called Knowhere. Unfortunately, even here there would be no peace for the last of the Nova Centurions as he was attacked by zombies under the control of an unknown evil called Abyss. However, after making an ally in a talking dog named Cosmo, Nova was able to defeat the villain and restore peace to Knowhere. Learning that Nova was transmode positive, Cosmo used the resources at his disposal to chart Nova a course for the birthplace of the Phalanx, Kvch, in hopes that Nova can find a way to cure himself of the virus that is slowly killing him."

20,Sandman (DC)(01 - Wesley Dodds),Wesley Dodds ,20_20051214051743_char.jpg,,,"Wesley Dodds, the Golden Age Sandman, was the (DC) world's first costumed super-hero--according, at least, to one interpretation of the DCU's internal chronology.  (The events of Crisis on Infinite Earths has thrown that interpretation into some doubt.  Indeed, Crisis lent seemingly irresolvable doubt to virtually every Golden Age hero's 'first appearance in the DCU timeline' date.) |||| |||| In our world, though, his date of first publication slightly postdates Superman's, is roughly concurrent with Batman's, and significantly postdates the (newspaper) appearances of The Phantom, Zorro, and several other 'pulpy' predecessors. |||| |||| Nevertheless, he is one of the earliest American comic superheroes--despite, like Batman, having no supernatural powers.  And certainly, in the 2005 DCU, he can safely be said to predate Superman, Batman, and most other superheroes--even if it's rather more tricky to say with authority that he's the 'original' superhero of the DCU.  (Events of the 2005/6 Infinite Crisis may shake up the DCU's past once again, though, giving us clearer answers in the near future.) |||| |||| More apt to solve mysteries than perform super heroic feats, Dodds is usually accompanied by his love interest (and sometimes sidekick) Dian Belmont, as well as his usual sidekick, Sandy the Golden Boy. |||| |||| Dodds uses the visions received in dreams to solve mysteries."

Part of the division of the Imperial Guard known as the Superguardians, Titan was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix Lilandra from her insane brother, then-Majestor D'ken. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor. |||| |||| Later, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne from her sister Lilandra, Titan was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as Excalibur and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named Rachel Summers. |||| |||| Much later, the intergalactic teleporter Lila Cheney transported the X-Men to the Shi'ar Empire at the behest of then-Empress Deathbird in time to see Lilandra regain her throne.

200,Warbird (Marvel)(01 - Carol Danvers),Carol Susan Jane Danvers. ,200_20070119222449_char.jpg,"Warbird's powers included flight, enhanced strength, durability and the ability to shoot concussive energy bursts from her hands.",,"Carol Danvers entered the Air Force upon graduating from high school to pursue her love of aircraft and her dreams of flying. Carol was a top student at the Air Force Academy and enjoyed a rapid career advancement rising to the rank of Major. Because of her stellar performance, superb combat skills and natural intellect, Carol was recruited into the intelligence field. She ended up serving with the C.I.A., during which time she met and worked with Colonel Nick Fury. She was partnered with Colonel Michael Rossi and the two became lovers. Carol had a distinguished career in the C.I.A. |||| |||| While on special assignment with Nick Fury, Carol met the Canadian agent called Logan. The two were eventually paired up and shared a number of adventures together. During one of their infamous escapades, they clashed with the brutal Sabretooth who was working for the Hellfire Club. During their time together, Logan and Carol became close friends, perhaps even lovers. Both have saved each other's lives numerous times. |||| |||| When Carol was captured by the KGB and imprisoned at Lubyanka prison, Logan was among those who defied orders to save her. Following her affiliation with the C.I.A., Carol took a position with N.A.S.A. as the security director for Cape Canaveral. It was in this capacity that Carol first met Captain Marvel, the Kree warrior, Mar-Vell. In her official capacity, Carol was challenged with unraveling the mystery of this alien soldier. During her investigation, the two forged a unique bond, first as friends and then as lovers. It was this relationship that would change Carol forever. |||| |||| Captain Marvel's mortal enemy, Colonel Yon-Rogg kidnapped Carol, using her as bait in his conflict with Mar-vell. In the course of the battle, Carol and Mar-vell were caught in the explosion of a Kree Psyche-Magneton device. The energy bombardment somehow caused Carol�s genetic structure to be melded with Mar-vell's. While Mar-vell was apparently unaltered by the event, Carol was now a perfect hybrid of Kree and human genes. In addition, she possessed all of Mar-vell's Kree knowledge and training. Through this transformation, Ms. Marvel was born. |||| |||| Because of her failure to capture Captain Marvel, Carol lost her job at N.A.S.A. She recovered quickly, writing a successful novel about her experience in the space industry. This lead to her landing a position as the editor of WOMAN magazine, a subsidiary of the Daily Bugle. Carol's viewpoints as a staunch feminist created tensions with her boss J. Jonah Jameson, but made her the perfect choice to be Woman Magazine's editor. |||| |||| Just as Carol was beginning this new chapter of her life, the powers and persona of Ms. Marvel began to emerge. At first, Carol experienced blackouts triggered by Ms. Marvel's precognitive seventh sense and the two persona were very distinct, both mentally and physically. As time went on and Carol came to accept her new role as Ms. Marvel, the two personalities merged. A second exposure to the energies of a Kree Psyche-Magnetron also imbued Ms. Marvel with some of the properties which formally resided in her Kree uniform (namely flight and the ability to change into costume at will). |||| |||| Carol fought many villains during her career as Ms. Marvel, including Deathbird, MODOK, A.I.M., the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, the Hellfire Club, and Mystique. She also joined the Avengers for a brief period, and it was this affiliation which drew Carol to the attention of Marcus. The son of Immortus, Marcus observed the Avengers from afar and became obsessed with Ms. Marvel. Marcus kidnapped Carol using Immortus' technology to manipulate her mind and seduce her into loving him. Marcus impregnated Carol with a child who would rapidly grow up into Marcus himself, enabling him to escape Limbo. He returned Carol to the Avengers, unaware of her time and seduction in Limbo. Carol was shocked when she learned that she was pregnant and devastated since she was completely unaware of the identity of the father. The pregnancy ran its course in a matter of days, leaving Carol shaken - both as a woman and a hero. The child grew within a day into a full-grown man, one who was determined to win his 'mother's' love. Carol, still bewildered by the entire experience, agreed to accompany Marcus back to Limbo. The Avengers wished the pair well. In Limbo, Marcus continued to age rapidly and quickly died of old age, leaving Carol alone in Limbo and free of his mind control. Carol was sickened by Marcus' manipulations and felt betrayed by the Avengers who failed to question Marcus` actions or motives. |||| |||| Carol mastered Immortus' technology and returned to Earth, choosing to settle in San Francisco instead of returning to the Avengers. Carol's return to Earth was sensed by the precognitive Destiny. Destiny had previously prophesied that Ms. Marvel would be involved in an event that would destroy the life of Mystique's foster daughter, Rogue. Mystique had vowed to destroy Ms. Marvel before this could happen and developed an obsessive hatred for Ms. Marvel. Rogue, overhearing Destiny's concerns and Mystique's ranting, decided to take the battle to Carol herself. Rogue attacked Carol in San Francisco and the pair fought atop the Golden Gate Bridge. When Rogue tried to use her power-absorbing abilities on Carol, something went terribly wrong, and she absorbed too much of Carol's persona, making the transferal permanent. Driven mad by Carol's thoughts and memories, Rogue threw Carol's body from the bridge. Amazingly, Carol was rescued by Spider-Woman. At the hospital, Carol was identified and diagnosed as a blank slate. Jessica Drew called in Professor Xavier of the X-Men, who was able to pull forth Carol's memories and personality from her subconscious. However, he was unable to restore her emotional connection to those memories and experiences. Carol and Jessica spent some time at the X-Mansion while Carol recovered from her ordeal. |||| |||| During this time, a now-powerless Carol confronted the Avengers and vented her anger for their betrayal of her. Carol remained with the X-Men for a brief time, during which she often accompanied them on missions. One such mission led to Carol's capture by the alien Brood. Fascinated by her Kree/Human physiology, the Brood performed experiments on Carol's genetic structure. This unleashed the full potential of Carol�s Kree/Human physiology transforming her into the cosmic-powered Binary. Carol now possessed more power than ever due to her link to a white hole. |||| |||| Carol returned with the X-Men and was strongly considering joining them on a permanent basis when the desperately troubled Rogue came to Xavier for help. Upon seeing Rogue, Carol flew into a rage and punched her into orbit. The X-Men reluctantly informed Carol that Xavier had allowed Rogue to join the X-Men. Unable to accept this, Carol opted to join the space pirates known as the Starjammers and to leave her troubles on Earth behind. As Binary, Carol was a valued member of the Starjammers and fought alongside them to restore Lilandra to the Shi'ar throne. In space, Carol was able to escape her loss and rebuild her life. The stars were her escape and offered her a whole universe in which to escape the emptiness her former life represented. Carol remained with the Starjammers for a number of years. During this time, she lived out her lifelong dream of exploring the stars. She formed a close friendship with Raza Longknife, the sullen cyborg member of the Starjammers. Despite fighting the Shi'ar forces and her former enemy Deathbird, Carol found herself frustrated at the lack of challenge among the Starjammers' adversaries. When Earth's sun was threatened, Carol chose to abandon her mission for the Shi'ar Majestrix Lilandra Neramani and aid the Avenger Quasar in saving it. This effort left Carol in a depleted state, and she spent months recuperating at the Avengers Mansion. During this time, she reconciled with the Avengers. When the Starjammers came to Earth and into conflict with the Avengers, Carol helped resolve the conflict and decided to try and rebuild her life on Earth. |||| |||| Recently, Carol rechristened herself Warbird and rejoined the Avengers, following a reality-warping conflict with Morgan Le Fay. She brought with her a whole new set of problems. First, her powers were slowly depleting, and she attempted to hide this fact from the Avengers, leading to a conflict with Captain America. Carol had also developed a drinking problem, which was immediately noticed by recovering alcoholic and fellow Avenger, Iron Man. Her drinking, coupled with her determination to prove herself a worthy addition to the Avengers and her secretiveness about her power loss, led to reckless grand-standing and sloppy teamwork. This eventually endangered the lives of her teammates and led to a formal court-martial before her fellow Avengers. Rather than face her problems and a forced demotion to reserve status, Carol quit the team. This all occurred amidst the Avengers' conflict with a rebel faction of Kree. Seeking to join the battle despite leaving the team, Carol realized that she no longer had the capability to reach escape velocity in order to join the battle on the Moon between the Avengers and the Kree Lunatic Legion. |||| |||| Disheartened, Carol realized that she'd hit rock bottom, and moved to Seattle to work on rebuilding her career as a freelance writer and novelist. She started to make some progress in accepting her alcoholism but refused to accept that she had a serious problem for months. After her drinking almost led to disaster in a number of combat situations, Carol was hospitalized for alcohol poisoning. Carol's doctor warned that she had done considerable damage to her internal organs and that another drink might kill her. This diagnosis combined with the knowledge that she had nearly killed a plane full of people during a drunken rage have forced Carol to admit the severity of her drinking problem. Carol has now accepted that she is an alcoholic and has started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings on a regular basis. She has since been accepted into the ranks of the Avengers and taken the name Ms. Marvel once again. |||| |||| When the Scarlet Witch warped reality, Carol was one of the few people who remembered the events when reality was restored, and she determined to prove her worth as a true hero, something she had experienced during the events. She told this to Captain America when he offered her membership in the new Avengers team, but she declined, feeling unready to join that august assemblage. Cap assured her that a place would always be available to her in the Avengers."

On an out-of-service rail-track an odd and driverless subway car stopped to pick-up Billy and his companion.

On one side of the cavernous hall grotesque statues of the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man: Pride, Envy, Greed, Hatred, Selfishness, Laziness and Injustice loomed. |||| |||| As mysteriously as he appeared the stranger vanishes. Sitting on a throne at the far-end of the hall is a wizened old man with long white hair and a full, almost floor-length white beard. At the old man’s beckoning, Billy steps forward and stops in front of the throne. |||| |||| The old man announces himself by proclaiming, 'I am Shazam!,' amid a peal of thunder and flash of lightning. As the smoke clears Billy notices the wall behind the wizard is inscribed with the names of six great elders which together form the name SHAZAM: Solomon- wisdom, Hercules - strength, Atlas - stamina, Zeus - power, Achilles - Courage, and Mercury - speed. Shazam relates to the young boy that he needs a new champion to battle evil and that he has chosen Billy. 'Speak my name' shouts Shazam! |||| |||| As Billy shouts the name of the ancient wizard, lightning drops from the ceiling of the chamber striking him, while at the same time a deafening peal of thunder echoes off the cavern walls. As the smoke clears, Billy discovers that he has been transformed into a man! |||| |||| 'Captain Marvel, I salute you,' says Shazam! At that moment a slab of stone hanging above Shazam’s head, held in place by a tattered thread, crashes down onto the old wizard crushing him. From the dust and rumble a ghostly image of Shazam appears and lights a nearby brazier. |||| |||| At that, Captain Marvel sets off to track down the evil radio silencer plaguing his fair city — and at that Captain Marvel meets his arch-nemesis for the first time: Dr. Thaddeus Bodog Sivana!"

After her father died, her mother worked three jobs to put her daughter through the best colleges and Karla vowed never to end up like her mother, and never to put another's needs before her own. Despite building a successful psychological practice, Karla so disliked being dependent on her patients for income that she and entered the super-criminal world as an aide to Dr. Faustus. Learning of Moonstone (Lloyd Bloch), she became his psychologist and manipulated him into rejecting his moonstone, which she then absorbed to gain the powers of Moonstone. |||| |||| |||| Karla worked briefly for the Corporation, controlling the Hulk and manipulating General Thunderbolt Ross into a nervous breakdown. She continued to pursue greater power, stealing Curt Connors' Enervator and searching the moon's surface for further moonstone fragments. First Egghead and then Baron (Helmut) Zemo recruited Moonstone for their Masters of Evil, and she aided each against the Avengers. After the last of these fights, she decided to serve out her prison term and give up her criminal life. However, when Zemo formed a group of villains to masquerade as heroes, he broke Moonstone out of the Vault and she returned to villainy as the Thunderbolt Meteorite. After their ruse was exposed, she remained with the Thunderbolts as they tried to reform, becoming romantically involved with Hawkeye. |||| |||| |||| Karla's road to redemption was less than smooth. She executed the Kosmosian Primotur, and appeared to betray the Thunderbolts to both the new Masters of Evil and Graviton before rejoining the team. When the Thunderbolts were trapped on Counter-Earth, Karla removed a second moonstone from that world's Lloyd Bloch (known there as the Phantom Eagle), dramatically increasing her own powers. When the Avengers later interfered in the Thunderbolts' plan to control the world's 'transnormal energy,' a failsafe Karla had planted against Zemo was triggered and the stolen energy was funnelled into her moonstones. Karla attempted to use this energy to flee, but the Thunderbolts and Avengers combined forces to stop her. In the end, Zemo ended up in possession of both moonstones and Karla was left comatose. |||| |||| Currently, Zemo is in control of Karla, forcing her to act as a puppet (in such acts as attacking the Thunderbolts).
