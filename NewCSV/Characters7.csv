154,Mole Man (Marvel),Harvey Rupert Elder ,154_20060511131112_char.jpg,"The Mole Man possesses heightened senses of hearing, smell, and touch; although almost blind, he has somehow developed a compensatory radar sense enabling him to detect objects within his vicinity. Almost a century old, he has the appearance of a man roughly half his age and the vitality of one even younger.",,"Born in the late 1910s, Harvey Elder possessed a genius intellect but was shunned because of his homely appearance. Hearing rumors of an underground kingdom where he might find acceptance or at least solitude, Elder spent years searching the globe for it, without success. In 1956, he tried to join the Explorers Club on the basis of his exploits, but he was disbelieved and ridiculed. Fuming, he chanced to observe a gathering of adventurers by the Eternal Makkari, who sought a team of Monster Hunters to aid him against the Deviant Kro and his monstrous Mutates; believing the group's efforts would lead them to his subterranean goal, Elder stowed away on their plane and was separated from the heroes in the course of the battle. |||| |||| Washing up on the shores of Monster Island, he explored a series of caverns until he at last discovered Subterranea, a network of tunnels running beneath the surface of much of the Earth; however, he was caught in an earthquake and almost blinded in the mysterious Valley of Diamonds. Undaunted, Elder explored the vastness of Subterranea and carved out a kingdom of his own. His early activities may have influenced various subterranean monster incursions that plagued the U.S. and other nations during the late 1950s and early 1960s. He discovered and mastered Deviant technology, proving himself a rival to the underground reigns of the monstrous Two-Headed Thing and the immortal Tyrannus, and later fighting Spragg the Living Hill. Slowing his own aging through unknown means, the Mole Man eventually won rulership of the so-called Moloid race, docile servants abandoned by the Deviants, as well as of many of the Mutates once used for conquest or sport by their former masters. |||| |||| In recent years, having achieved a satisfactory power base, the Mole Man launched his first known attack on the surface world, dispatching his Mutates to destroy power plants in preparation for an all-out invasion; however, his campaign had only begun when he attracted the attention of the newly-formed Fantastic Four, who entered Subterranea via its Monster Island entrance and defeated the Mole Man and his monsters, destroying the entrance in the process. Regrouping, he led the Fantastic Four into a trap while he prepared to continue his assault on humanity by sinking entire cities, but was again defeated. He next sank buildings in New York City, successfully taking the Invisible Girl hostage to prevent the Fantastic Four from opposing his intended world conquest; the Fantastic Four rescued her, though she suffered a head injury and was only saved by emergency surgery. |||| |||| He was also one of the villains that Doctor Doom used to attack Reed and Sue's wedding. He burst through the floor with his Moloids, but was driven back when Professor X called his X-Men to fight them, along with the Thing's help. |||| |||| The Mole Man subsequently battled the Avengers, both alongside the communist Red Ghost and assisted by his giant Minotaur. A closer enemy was his rival Tyrannus, who ruled a second servant race, the Tyrannoids, and sought the Mole Man's territory for himself. Both underground rulers used surface heroes, such as the Hulk and X-Men, as pawns in their war, but the Mole Man soon turned his dimmed eyes back to conquest; he sought to blind humanity as he imagined it had been blinded to his accomplishments. Mistakenly assuming Project: Earthdig, intended to bury nuclear waste deep within the planet, was an assault on him, the Mole Man joined forces with Dr. Erik Gorbo (the Monster-Ape) against Captain America and plotted another surface assault before learning the truth. The Mole Man formed an alliance with the Netherworld's Queen Kala, whom he hoped to romance, and even managed to enslave Tyrannus; but Kala ultimately betrayed him to Tyrannus, who betrayed her in turn, leaving the Fantastic Four to triumph over the trio. |||| |||| Seeking to spare others the scorn he had suffered, the Mole Man united his old and new worlds by welcoming some of surface society's rejects into Subterranea as his Outcasts, empowering four of them - Boulder, Digger, Landslide, and Water Witch - as Super-Outcasts. When Kala led the fiery Lava Men in an attack on his kingdom to regain access to the Fountain of Youth, the Mole Man agreed to a contest between his Outcasts and her operatives, Olympic athletes whom she granted high-tech weaponry and forced to assist her. The conflict drew the Hulk and Spider-Man into the fray, fighting for Kala and the Mole Man, respectively. Kala failed and was abandoned by her army, but the Mole Man took pity upon her and renewed their relationship. His struggles continued against the likes of the Galadorian Spaceknight ROM and the alien Dire Wraiths, as well as Heroes for Hire Power Man (Luke Cage) and Iron Fist. Mellowing somewhat, he soon took Tyrannus' abandoned Tyrannoids under his wing as well. He and Kala ruled peacefully until would-be Messiah Alden Maas, in his mad attempt to expand the Earth, unleashed magma flows in Subterranea, killing many of its inhabitants. Abandoned by Kala and half-mad with grief and rage, the Mole Man sought to raise a new continent for his people, regardless of the devastation such a tectonic shift would cause. The Thing briefly joined the Outcasts during a period of extreme depression, befriending the Mole Man and remaining unaware of his secret agenda, but he left with the Fantastic Four after learning the truth. Lost in holographic illusions of the surface society that had rejected him so long ago, the Mole Man barely noticed when the Fantastic Four halted the tectonic procedure, burying him and his equipment beneath tons of rock. |||| |||| Months later, having regained his sanity, the Mole Man decided it was time for peace with the surface world, only to be attacked by Fantastic Four clones created by Aron the Rogue Watcher, renewing his desire for war. Following an encounter with the Skrull De'Lila and the replacement Fantastic Four - Ghost Rider, Hulk, Spider-Man, and Wolverine - he found his Moloids and Tyrannoids under attack by the Lava Men, all of whom had been attacked in his absence and partially sterilized by the High Evolutionary's forces; with the Fantastic Four's help, he put an end to the hostilities and eventually united the tribes under his rule. During a battle with old foe Spragg, he sought to claim She-Hulk as his bride, but was instead briefly turned into an actual mole. When the Deviants began to exert their power in Subterranea once more, he protected his domain alongside the returned Tyrannus and Grotesk, last survivor of the Gor-Tokians, yet another underground race. Disaster was averted by the Avengers, and Kala returned to the Mole Man's side as his fiancée. Hoping to win more allies, he offered Monster Island as sanctuary to the misfit heroes of the short-lived Infinity Watch, but an immense tidal wave caused him to withdraw from Monster Island, severing his ties with the Watch. |||| When the Fantastic Four and other heroes vanished during the Onslaught crisis, the Mole Man, evidently bored by protracted peace, laid plans for yet another invasion; but when word of the heroes' return reached him, he chose practicality over ego and abandoned the effort. The long-suffering Moloids faced yet another crisis when they were absorbed into a host body for the alien Terminus, but the Mole Man freed his subjects through cooperation with the Fantastic Four, who defeated Terminus. The Mole Man subsequently stole a sewage treatment plant to save his Moloids, sensitized during recent exposure to the surface world, from pollution trickling into his domain. After years of failed conquest attempts, the Mole Man established an uneasy neutrality with the Fantastic Four and other surface heroes, providing occasional aid when it suited his interests and fighting them only out of misunderstanding or manipulation. Kala's seeming disappearance from his side may foretell further upheavals within the Subterranean nations. Recently, however, using a sample of his DNA obtained during an aborted plot of the Mad Thinker, the Fantastic Four ambushed and captured the Mole Man, placing him in stasis aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier as part of their efforts to preemptively imprison all of their foes."
314,Elongated Man (DC),Ralph Dibny ,314_20060730203145_char.jpg,Can elongate any part of his body.,,"Intrigued by the “Indian Rubber Men” he saw at carnivals throughout his youth, Ralph Dibny spent years trying to learn their secret. Eventually he noticed that many of the contortionists liked a particular soft drink called Gingold. He isolated the key ingredient—the juice of a little-known tropical fruit called the gingo—and distilled it. By drinking this gingold extract, Dibny gained the ability to stretch any part of his body to fantastic lengths. |||| |||| Recently, Sue was tragically killed in the couple’s Opal City home. In his grief, Ralph has quit drinking Gingold and given up his powers. He is investigating a resurrection cult, and the mystery of the Helmet of Fate."

4855,Firebird (Marvel),Bonita Juarez ,4855_20160823080613_char.jpg,"Firebird can generate heat and flame, controlling these with molecular precision. She can project heat waves, fire blasts and flame constructs; create powerful winds by manipulating air temperatures; use convection currents and thermal updrafts to carry tremendous weights aloft; and fly fast enough to achieve escape velocity. She can mentally control any heat or flame in her vicinity, and is physically immune to extreme heat and fire. Firebird has also displayed more mysterious, possibly mystical abilities. She sometimes has visions, can sense the presence of evil (especially supernatural evil), has uncanny intuition, and seems immune to demonic possession. Most remarkably, Bonita may be immortal, having proven miraculously immune to potentially fatal conditions such as the vacuum of space, a universal poison (powerful enough to kill even the Silver Surfer) and massive radiation. The Collector believes she may be one of the few beings in the universe who cannot die.",,"A devout Catholic social worker of Mexican ancestry, Bonita Juarez was wandering her beloved desert outside Albuquerque when a fiery meteor struck mere feet away from her. Miraculously unharmed, Bonita discovered she now had supernatural power over flame, which she used days later to foil a convenience store robbery. Described as 'Pajaro Del Fuego' by one of the robbers, Juarez took the costumed alias Firebird and protected the American Southwest, both alone and as a member of the short-lived Rangers team. Later, after she was attacked by the demonic Master Pandemonium, Bonita tracked and fought him alongside the new western Avengers roster. Eager to join their ranks, Bonita aided them against other foes such as the Werewolf and the Cat People, but team leader Hawkeye passed over her in favor of the Thing. Firebird's subsequent attempt to revive the Rangers was a failure (though she did succeed in exposing the demonic possession of her old teammate Shooting Star), and she soon left on a spiritual retreat. |||| |||| |||| Returning in a more overtly religious guise as Espirita, Bonita helped a suicidally depressed Hank Pym rebuild his life, sharing a brief romance with him. She also helped rescue the western Avengers from Dominus' time travel trap, using a message from Hawkeye entrusted to her family over two hundred years earlier. She later met SHIELD (the Society of Higher Interstellar Education and Logistical Development), a group of alien scholars who claimed the meteor that empowered her was waste material from one of their failed experiments. Bonita accepted the revelation as a lesson in humility, comforting herself with the belief that God might still be the author of her powers, albeit more indirectly than she had first imagined. |||| |||| |||| Resuming her original alias as Firebird, she returned to her career as a social worker and became an Avengers reservist, aiding the team against various foes such as the Awesome Android, the Acts of Vengeance conspiracy, Atlantean invaders, SURF, Morgan le Fay and Dominex, and helping monitor the captured Bloodwraith and an alien invasion of Madripoor. She has declined several offers of full-time Avengers membership as she is devoted to her church work, but she did temporarily join the active roster for the duration of the Kang Dynasty war, helping liberate Earth and successfully counselling a disillusioned Thor. ||||"
637,Constrictor (Marvel)(01 - Frank Schlichting),Frank Schlichting ,637_20051224171825_char.jpg,"The Constrictor wears an electrically-insulated, partially bullet-proofed battlesuit whose chief offensive weapon is the twin lengths of cybernetically-controlled, electrically-powered cables. These cables, which eject and retract from special appliances running from shoulder to wrist, are made of an Adamantium alloy (Adamantium being the strongest metal forged by man). Able to extend a maximum length of 30 feet, the Adamantium cables can be used as whips, capable of rending steel and lesser metals; or as bonds, capable of entwining an object or human being and constricting with a maximum force of 115 pounds per square inch. Once securely around an object or human being the cables are unbreakable. They can kill an average human being by constriction in a matter of seconds. |||| |||| The Constrictor wears a power-pack in the bullet-proof chest area of his suit capable of generating a powerful electrical charge which he can direct through the length of the cables. He can generate a maximum charge of 35,000 volts of high frequency electricity for up to 3 minutes before depleting his power-pack. He can cyboernetically control the amount of voltage he channels through each cable. |||| |||| The cybernetic circuitry controlling the functions of the functions of the cables is located in the forehead area of his cowl. The circuitry housing is bullet-proofed and insulated against most forms of jamming radiations.",,"Frank Payne was presumably a child of divorced parents, as he was raised by a single, if abusive, father. Payne grew up to become an agent for the international espionage organization S.H.I.E.L.D.. Payne was working deep undercover as Frank Schlichting, a small-time hoodlum and enforcer for the Chicago-area mobs. After an incident where he was forced to shoot several of members of a rival gang, Payne snapped. He went to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s director, Nick Fury, to ask to be taken off of the case. However, Fury forced him to go back. Days later, an infuriated and fed-up Payne dropped all contact with S.H.I.E.L.D. |||| |||| Despite his previous aversion to killing, Frank, now Frank Schlichting, next appeared on the West Coast to make a name for himself as a criminal mercenary. Applying to Eugene Kligger of the now-defunct criminal organization known as the Corporation, Schlichting was outfitted with the armor, equipment, and identity of the Constrictor and became their special operative and hit man. |||| |||| His first public mission brought him into conflict with the Hulk, but the Corporation soon dissolved and left the Constrictor as a freelance criminal. He then ran afoul of Captain America. He sought employment from the criminal financier Justin Hammer and was ordered alongside other hired criminals to take out Iron Man, but he was unsuccessful. He next teamed up with Sabretooth in a partnership, but the two were thwarted by Luke Cage and Iron Fist. The Constrictor was invited to join the criminal organization, the Serpent Society, at one point, but he refused, and he embarked on several solo criminal activities, which were stopped by the likes of Captain America and Spider-Man. |||| |||| The Constrictor joined another group, the Masters of Evil, under the leadership of the latest Crimson Cowl. The Masters sought to pool their resources from various crimes, and soon tried their hands at a worldwide blackmail scheme, but they were all defeated by the Thunderbolts. |||| |||| More recently, the villain Sabretooth was left for dead when his Adamantium-laced skeleton was ripped from his body by the villain Apocalypse. The Constrictor was forced by the hero Gambit to give up his coils to save Sabretooth's life, although Frank soon obtained his current Vibranium models. |||| |||| The Constrictor briefly shared an apartment with two other villains, Titania (actually Copycat in disguise) and Deadpool. During a rare moment of camaraderie, he revealed that he had a daughter by the name of Mia Payne, although she remains unaware of her father's career as the Constrictor. (Nick Fury had told Payne's family that Payne, whose cover had been as a business executive, had died in a plane crash.) |||| |||| Recently, the Constrictor has come into a large amount of money. During an armed hijacking, he and fellow villains Jack O'Lantern and the Armadillo were thwarted by Hercules, who left the Constrictor seriously injured. The Constrictor sued Hercules for damages, and Hercules was convinced by Jennifer Walters, She-Hulk, to do the honorable thing and pay up. With his $168 million in damages, the Constrictor became a member of the idle rich. |||| Although he never felt as if he belonged with such society, Frank Schlicting attended a party hosted by Carlotta LaRosa. This was the event of the year, attended by Tony 'Iron Man' Stark, Kyle 'Nighthawk' Richmond, and Carlotta's then-current boyfriend, Ben 'the Thing“ Grimm. A snubbed debutante who was left off the guest list hired Arcade to kidnap the party-goers and put them in one of his Murderworld amusement parks. As a former villain himself, Nighthawk hoped to convince Frank that he could find a new purpose in life, and the Constrictor helped the Thing and Tony Stark rescue the guests."

11512,Leo (Marvel)(02 - Male LMD),,11512_20070317183816_char.jpg,,,"Created by Scorpio (Jake Fury) using the Zodiac Key to serve as members of his own Zodiac organization. Scorpio went after his brother, Nick Fury, with his new group, but was defeated by The Defenders and Moon Knight. |||| |||| The Zodiac LMD's were recruited by Quicksilver during his bout with temporary insanity, and Quicksilver ordered the Zodiac LMD's to destory The Avengers for their imagined wrong doings. The Avengers managed to defeat the group and most were remanded into federal custody. |||| |||| The android Zodiac were soon released, and the Scorpio LMD rebuilt a number of them. Scorpio used the Zodiac Key to create LMDs that exemplified the forces and personalities inherent in each sign, hoping to create great strength in the combination of all twelve traits of the Zodiac. |||| |||| At some point the android Zodiac captured and presumably killed the human Scorpio, Jacques LaPoint. Jacob Fury's Scorpio android then impersonated him and infiltrated the original, human Zodiac organization. He arranged the ambush in which the android Zodiac killed all of the remaining human Zodiac leaders except Cornelius van Lunt, alias Taurus. It was later revealed the Libra had also survived the attack on the original Zodiac Cartel. |||| |||| Immediately afterward, Van Lunt sought out the services of the Avengers' West Coast branch to confront and defeat the android Zodiac. In their initial foray, the Avengers failed, although several androids were destroyed. Sagittarius, in particular, was destroyed and replaced with an LMD replica of the Avengers’ Hawkeye. Hawkeye's LMD was used to infiltrate the Avengers' headquarters, and Scorpio also made a Leo LMD in the form of the Avengers’ Tigra for additional infiltration. This new Leo LMD helped the Zodiac gain an upper hand when the Avengers tracked the Zodiac to their refuge in Death Valley, California, but the first android Leo took offence at being replaced. He battled Scorpio directly, seemingly destroying him. |||| |||| The Zodiac Key immediately resurrected the Scorpio LMD. Claiming superiority and believing that the Zodiac would eventually kill the Avengers as the androids could never be stopped, Scorpio wanted to use the Key to transport everyone on the scene to the Key's native dimension where the conflict, he believed, could be prolonged indefinitely. However, when the androids were in the other dimension, they ceased to function because each of them were aligned with a particular zodiacal energy, energy that did not exist in the other dimension. The Avengers found Hawkeye and Tigra had been sent to the same dimension and, reunited, the team was sent back to Earth by the Brotherhood. However, secretly the Brotherhood waited so that someday they could also send the Key to Earth again and create new conflicts for them."

373,Jessica Campbell Jones (Marvel),,373_20080116115446_char.jpg,"Flight, super strength, high resistance to injury.",,"Jessica Jones was a lonely Midtown High School student with a crush on fellow student Peter Parker (who would soon become the hero Spider-Man) and a fantasy fixation on the Human Torch. She was on a trip to Disney World with her family when her father, distracted by the backseat quarrel of her and her brother, lost control of their car in an accident with an army truck transporting unidentified experimental material, possibly radioactive, to which Jessica was exposed in the course of the accident. Her father, mother, and brother were killed, and Jessica sustained injuries that put her in a coma for months. While the Fantastic Four clashed with Galactus outside her hospital window, Jessica awoke from her coma; she was placed in a home for wayward children and later adopted by a family named Jones, whose name she took. |||| |||| Months after the accident, while running home from school in an emotionally distraught state, Jessica manifested superhuman powers as a result of the experimental material to which she had been exposed; her inexperienced flying led her to crash-land in the bay, where she was rescued by Thor. She soon realized that she had also gained superhuman strength. While testing her flight capabilities, she chanced upon and defeated the costumed criminal known as the Scorpion, in desperate straits not long after his first defeat by Spider-Man. Proclaimed a hero, Jessica soon took on the costumed identity of Jewel, beginning her heroic career less than three years after Spider-Man's debut. |||| |||| Little is known of Jessica's career as Jewel, but her activities were evidently not as high-profile as those of many of New York's other costumed heroes. Nevertheless, she remained active for around four years, befriending a handful of other heroes, until she came upon a riot provoked by the Purple Man. Using his pheromone powers to take control of her, the Purple Man directed her to attack the approaching police, then held her in his thrall for months, subjecting her to physical and mental humiliation in imagined retaliation for his defeats by other super heroes. Finally, in a fit of insane rage, he sent Jessica to Avengers Mansion hoping she would find and kill his nemesis, Daredevil. Jessica attacked the first hero she saw, the Scarlet Witch, an act that snapped her out of the Purple Man's control. Unprepared to explain her actions, she fled and was pursued by the Avengers, taking a powerful blow from the Vision. Ms. Marvel rescued her from further attack, but Jessica was rendered comatose and cared for in a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility until Phoenix of the X-Men telepathically helped her regain her faculties. After weeks of physical rehabilitation, she was offered the position of S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison to the Avengers, but Jessica felt that her experience had taught her that she was unsuited to the life of a costumed hero, and she gave up her Jewel identity. Moreover, she found that the Purple Man's mistreatment had left her emotionally unsure of herself, particularly in romantic endeavors. |||| |||| Details of Jessica's subsequent life are sparse, although it is known that she was involved in a string of relationships that ended badly, including one with S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Clay Quartermain. She also became close friends with Ms. Marvel, who would undergo her own share of trauma during her Avengers membership and afterward. At one point Jessica attempted to return to costumed action as the Knightress, but this period was brief. She eventually became a licensed private investigator and opened her own firm, Alias Investigations. |||| |||| Jessica's recent string of cases included a surveillance assignment involving a woman whose companion was revealed to be Captain America, who changed from his then-secret identity into costume before Jessica's video camera; when the woman whom he had been photographed with was slain, Jessica realized she had been set up. She was questioned by suspicious police officers but helped out of her predicament by the timely arrival of attorney Matt Murdock. Her investigation led to a fight with enforcer Man-Mountain Marko and the revelation that she had been expected to publicize the video with the intent of creating a scandal defaming Captain America and the US government. With the help of S.H.I.E.L.D., Jessica exposed the plot's mastermind, a man named Zoumas, and received the thanks of Captain America, who encouraged her to return to the heroic life. Jessica next investigated a deranged man claiming to be Avengers associate Rick Jones, who paranoically feared attack by the alien races in whose war the real Jones had intervened. Jessica managed to partially calm his madness and reunited him with his wife. She was then hired by J. Jonah Jameson in an effort to track Spider-Man, only to bilk the publisher by spending his money on charitable endeavors. An out-of-town case led her to help troubled teen Rebecca Cross, who had run away after encouraging people to believe she was a mutant out of rebellion against her town's oppressive atmosphere, but the case ended badly when Rebecca's aunt killed her unjustly accused father. |||| |||| When Daredevil's secret identity as Matt Murdock was exposed, Murdock hired Jessica and the hero-for-hire Luke Cage as bodyguards. This initially proved awkward as Jessica and Cage had had a brief fling which strained their friendship, but they soon resolved their difficulties. Jessica instead began dating Scott Lang, the Avenger known as Ant-Man, with whom she was set up by her friend Carol Danvers, formerly Ms. Marvel and now Warbird. She next found herself investigating the Mutant Growth Hormone trade, and teamed up with fellow superhuman investigator and ex-costumed heroine Jessica Drew to rescue Mattie Franklin, the young heroine formerly known as Spider-Woman, from being misused by the dealers. She also hired the dedicated but annoying young Malcolm Powder as a part-time assistant. When the Kingpin sent the insane assassin Typhoid Mary against Murdock, Jessica and Cage worked together against her, getting her on the ropes so that Murdock could deliver a blow to end the fight. |||| |||| Jessica's greatest challenge came when relatives of some of the Purple Man's victims asked her to confront the imprisoned villain about his many murders, several of them committed on whims, in hopes that he would give their families a sense of closure by confessing to his killings. She was greatly apprehensive about confronting her former tormentor, but being consoled by Cage, she agreed to visit the Purple Man in prison, only to receive no useful information from the psychopathic mind-controller. The Purple Man then escaped in the chaos caused by the breakout of fellow prisoner Carnage, and he sought out Jessica in order to again control her. When the Avengers arrived, he commanded Jessica to fight them, but she activated a psychic defense trigger left in her mind by Phoenix years earlier and defied him, knocking him out with one blow. |||| In the aftermath of the confrontation, Jessica informed Ant-Man that she was pregnant with another man's child and the couple broke up. She instead moved in with Cage, the father, and the two began a long-term relationship. Jessica has since taken a position as a superhuman consultant with the Daily Bugle, working with reporter Ben Urich on stories related to New York's growing super hero population. After their daughter was born, Jessica and Luke were married in the company of their heroic friends."

The suit he wears amplifies his strength, allowing him to lift far more than an ordinary human. Wrist bands built into the suit permit him to fire energy blasts at opponents and also function as communication devices. The belt he wears allows him to project force-fields which can protect him from physical and energy-based attacks as well as forcibly repel objects away from him. It can also serve as a pocket of breathable air, allowing him to travel through water or space. His goggles have built in magnification settings and allow him to see in the infrared spectrum. A ring given to him by the Legion of Super Heroes permits him to fly. Finally, Booster's suit allows him to absorb mass from one place and eject it again later either in its original form or as an amalgamation of melted matter.","Without his gadgets, Booster Gold is nothing more than an ordinary man. His force-field, while powerful, consumes an awful lot of energy and requires time to recharge before it can be used again. Using his suit to absorb and release matter completely drains the forcefield projector, leaving him vulnerable for a period of time. |||| |||| In addition to all this, Booster Gold is a shameless self-promoter whose schemes for making money often get him into hot water with other heroes who are doing it for the good of humanity as opposed to doing it for the almighty dollar.",None entered.

Le Bon Gumbo, also known as Swamp Thing, formerly known as Alex Olsen, had recently retired to the Parliament of Trees, and the Earth was trying to form an Earth Elemental.  While it eventually found one in German pilot Albert Höllerer, it failed in this attempt, because fire was not present, and a white zombie-like creature emerged built over Gold's remains with fragmentary memories, including an ability to speak English at a below-average level.  He stole the prison garb of two escaped convicts, then was asked to lead a band of criminals who noticed that he could stand in their campfire without being burned. One of them called him Solomon Grundy when he said that he was 'born on Monday' like in the Mother Goose rhyme.  He led the group through several heists, and Green Lantern Alan Scott's ring would not work against him, so he didn't understand why the criminals cared about Green Lantern.  They instructed him to kill Green Lantern by throwing him off a terrace.  When he did so, there was a large green and yellow explosion.  He then grabbed a member of his gang, Jake, and threw him to the floor.  The rest of the gang told him that you should only kill enemies, but Jake was already dead, which Grundy did not understand because of the lack of flashes. |||| |||| After Green Lantern, whose ring would not work against Grundy because of his plant composition, pushed him in front of a train, he has consistently sought revenge against Green Lantern, and has been amoral enough to harm others who have gotten in his way.  Eventually, Green Lanterns Alan Scott and Hal Jordan sent him to the moon, where he had what was described as 'his first independent thought,' traveling to Earth-1, believing that he may have an equivalent there who would be his friend. |||| |||| His body was fragmented and sent to Earth-1, where it battled Superman, even as Swamp Thing Alec Holland attempted to save him, but Swamp Thing was still experiencing too much pain in speaking to communicate with Superman why he thought Grundy should be saved.  These duplicates were destroyed with a formula created by S.T.A.R. Labs. |||| |||| When Solomon Grundy learned of Scott's children, Jade and Obsidian, he attempted to kill them, but Jade showed him kindness, and he was willing to obey her, although he became subject to wicked forces and eventually conquered their team, Infinity, Inc. |||| |||| When Lex Luthor sent Swamp Thing reeling into Space, the Parliament of Trees assumed that he was dead and tried to put a new Swamp Thing, known as the Sprout, into Grundy's body.  When Swamp Thing returned, he was relieved that Grundy was not dead, but Grundy had no memory of him, and they fought.  Swamp Thing found Grundy too corrupt to be Earth's Elemental, and prevented the Sprout from assimilating with him."

He had remarkable control over his body and bodily systems, could communicate telepathically, and could psychically mesmerize others, often casting illusions directly into their minds.

As such, Druid could mentally control and manipulate plant life, earth, and animals within his vicinity, the full extent and range of which remain unknown. ||||",,"Anthony Druid got his medical degree from Harvard, then went on to study psychiatry. He retired from his psychiatric practice after several years to devote more time to his growing interest in the occult. He supported himself by writing popular books on psychology and related matters and by lecturing. In the midst of his research for a second book on the occult, Druid was summoned by an ailing Tibetan lama apparently in need of medical aid. The lama put Druid through a series of bizarre mystic and spiritual tests to ascertain Druid's worthiness. Finding him worthy, the dying lama opened Druid's mind to its hidden powers and taught him the mastery of certain mystic arts. (Apparently, the lama was actually the Ancient One, mentor of the Earth's Sorcerer Supreme. Druid was one of the Ancient One's first attempts at giving a disciple a degree of his powers.) |||| |||| Druid had remained in seclusion for several years, investigating occult matters personally and in secret. At one point, he teamed up with other clandestine 'monster-hunters', including Bloodstone and the Eternal hero Makkari, in stopping a threat from the underworldly Deviants. Soon, the Fantastic Four appeared, ushering in Earth's Age of Marvels, and later, Druid would find himself aiding the hero team Avengers against the Celtic monsters known as the Fomor. |||| |||| Doctor Druid was instrumental in freeing the Avengers Mansion from its occupation by the Masters of Evil, and he applied successfully for Avengers membership shortly thereafter. Not long after joining, Druid fell under the mental control of Ravonna (then called Nebula, later Terminatrix), who used Druid's mental powers to manipulate the Avengers into aiding her search for an ultimate weapon. Druid manipulated the other Avengers into electing him chairman to this end, but the Avengers soon discovered the plotters and opposed them in a conflict that ended with Druid and Ravonna being lost in the time stream. |||| |||| Druid eventually escaped, free of Ravonna's influence, rejuvenated into a younger version of himself and with a renewed purpose. He renewed his association with the Avengers as an occasional inactive reservist in hopes of mending fences with the group. For a time, he led the occult adventurers called the Shock Troop and later served with the Secret Defenders as the team's puppet leader under the auspices of Doctor Strange. |||| |||| More recently, Druid embarked on an obsessive quest to augment his magical powers, one which eventually led to his pact with Druidic gods of Celtic lore. The gods performed a grisly spell on Druid, binding him to nature in such a way to allow him to control plants and earth around him. Druid tried to surround himself with loyal followers, including the villain Nekra, who nevertheless supported and seduced Druid. Nekra, however, later summoned her true lord, Hellstorm, the Son of Satan, who battled Druid. Hellstorm mocked Druid, killing him and tossing his burning body in a garbage can. |||| |||| Druid was briefly resurrected alongside other fallen Avengers by the Grim Reaper, in order to serve in the Legion of the Unliving against the Avengers. He and the others broke free of the Reaper’s thrall, however, and returned to the afterlife."

Crawford's group, formerly known as Great Lakes Avengers, recently complied with a cease-and-desist order to stop infringing on the Avengers franchise, which led to the group's present name. At one point, Crawford and her teammates assisted S.H.I.E.L.D. in an attempt to apprehend the then-fugitive Thunderbolts in the Colorado Rockies, in an operation led by Colonel G.W. Bridge. Although the operation ultimately failed, it displayed Crawford's willingness to support law enforcement agencies. Crawford's stance on the mutant question is unknown, but it would appear that she is more concerned with balancing her conflicting supermodel/superhero careers than with the global conflict between humans and mutants. |||| |||| In fact, she recently suffered a crisis of conscience after the team’s member Dinah Soar died during a mission.

There he met up with and joined the Sandman in order to take over Earth, but the Fantastic Four, with the help of Crystal, beat him and used one of Reed's inventions to shut off his powers, allowing them to return him to the Negative Zone. Since then, Blastaar has tried to return to Earth and conquer it, but has been repulsed many times by various super heroes; including the Fantastic Four and the Avengers. While adventuring in the Negative Zone, the Fantastic Four have since run into Blastaar again on many occasions. Blastaar has also regained the throne of Baluur for himself, and then begun a conquest of the Negative Zone, which has been primarily kept in check by the interference of Blastaar's hated enemy, Annihilus."

Martinex was born on Pluto, although it was later revealed his ancestors were from the continent of Africa on Earth. |||| |||| He grew up to become a scientist. Like the other Pluvians, Martinex's body was completely covered by facets that were crystaline in appearance. This design was so that the Pluvians could withstand the extreme temperatures of their world. Martinex could also emit heat and cold from his hands. Martinex became the last surviving Pluvian after the Badoon exterminated all the other Pluvians. Martinex escaped the Badoon and teamed with Vance Astro, a human astronaut from the 20th century, Charlie-27, a Jovian, and Yondu, from Alpha Centauri, to fight the Badoon as the Guardians of the Galaxy. Eventually, the Guardians drove the Badoon from Earth and Martinex later became the team's reluctant leader. |||| |||| While looking for the shield of Captain America, the Guardians came into conflict with a team of superhumans known as Force.

8210,Seth (Marvel)(01 - Egyptian god),"Set, Sutekh, Typhon ",8210_20070126015958_char.jpg,"Seth has the attributes of a god of Heliopolis such as superhuman strength, immunity to all terrestrial disease and is immortal. Before the loss of his right hand, Seth was able to lift at least 90 tons but even now remains at superhuman levels. Seth, as all the gods of Heliopolis, he has flesh that is at least three times denser than that of human tissue, and has superhuman endurance. Seth’s powers also include the ability to provoke a person’s death with just a touch, or he can mystically speed up the aging process causing one to grow old in seconds. He can project concussive blasts from his hand, and he can project hypnotic powers from his eyes. Seth can also transform into a large serpent and retain his speech.",,"The gods of Heliopolis were once worshiped by the people of Egypt. Seth happens to be the God of death, and he initially sought out worshipers by deceiving a cult who followed the serpent demon Set. Since he could transform himself into a giant serpent, he made the cult believe that he was Set and they then chose to worship him. He also took a variation of the serpent demon’s name calling himself Seth. |||| |||| The god Osiris was the ruler of ancient Egypt and his wife is Isis, goddess of fertility. It was said that Seth was the offspring of these two Heliopolitan gods, but this statement has been proven false. Seth, in actuality, wanted to overthrow Osiris and claim himself ruler of the Gods of Heliopolis. Seth’s blood lust was fueled even further when his own wife, Nephthys, had a son, Anubis, with Osiris. Seth hatched a plan that enabled him to trick Osiris into entering a coffin and seal him away in a hidden location. However, Isis had eventually found the coffin, but Seth would not be denied his vengeance. He dismembered Osiris’ body into fourteen pieces and placed them in several places throughout Egypt. Isis would not have her husband disrespected that way, so she gathered up all of the pieces and used an ancient, forgotten magic to make her husband whole once more. Once resurrected, Osiris ordered his sons Anubis and Horus, who also helped with their father’s return, to find Seth so that he may pay for his betrayal. |||| |||| Seth and Osiris battled for many years, and in the end, Seth used deception to achieve his victory. Osiris, Isis and Horus were trapped within a pyramid that Seth sank under the sands. Seth then took control of the other-dimensional city of Heliopolis, and claimed that his enemies would never be free to plague him again. Seth also boasted that the only way they would be freed is if their ancestor, Atum-Re, were to return to Earth. The overthrown Heliopolitan gods stayed buried for many years until the pyramid was discovered in the United States. It was at this time that the three trapped deities used their magic to convince Odin, ruler of Asgard that he was Atum-Re so that they may be free once more. The son of Odin, the mighty Thor, wanted the Heliopolitan gods to remove the spell they cast, so he traveled with them to Heliopolis to confront the death god. The five of them battled Seth’s skeleton army, and Thor was convinced how great a threat Seth was, so he engaged him in battle directly. During their battle, Odin projected an energy blast at Seth that destroyed his right hand and led him to be defeated. Osiris then cast Seth off the Golden Bridge of the Gods and reclaimed leadership of Heliopolis when Seth was swallowed up by the ground below. |||| |||| Sometime later, Seth returned and captured his brother once more. He also captured his brother’s wife and son, Horus who he planned to sacrifice to gain control of a demon called the Devourer. Unfortunately for Seth, the Devourer turned against him, and it took the combined might of Thor and the Thing to defeat it. With Seth defeated, Osiris and his family were freed. Soon after, Seth formed an alliance with Mephisto and others who ruled the land of the dead such as Pluto and Hela to merge their realms into an individual realm of the dead so that their powers would be united. When these gods of the dead used their powers to unite the realms, Demogorge, the God-Eater was summoned and he ate Seth and the others. If not for Thor, Seth and the other gods of the dead would not have been saved. Fearing to release Demorgorge again, these individuals ended their alliance. |||| |||| After, the Rainbow Bridge had been destroyed severing the path between Earth and Asgard, Seth sent his armies to invade Asgard just as he sent his minion Grog the God Crusher to Earth to assassinate Thor. However, Thor was on the Avengers floating headquarters, Hydrobase, and when Grog attacked and Thor was assisted by the Black Knight and the Captain. Between the three of them, Grog’s forces were defeated and Grog was taken to the former prison for superhuman criminals, the Vault. After that, while Thor was attacked at a construction site by an assassin named Mongoose, the gods of Asgard sent Hogun, the Grim to Earth to find Thor and tell him of Seth’s invasion. Hogun did arrive on Earth, but his senses were scrambled and everyone around him appeared to be a threat which led him to a conflict with Daredevil and the police. The police gunned him down despite the protests of Daredevil, and Hogun had to be taken to the hospital where he was close to death. At the hospital, Seth made a bargain with three mortals who also lied at death’s door. He gave them incredible power and a vow to let them continue to live if they killed Hogun. Together these three, known as Earth Force, had an inevitable run in with Thor who was at the hospital once he got word that Hogun was there. Even though they had Thor beaten, two of the three members decided that they should rethink their position and leave before they did something they would regret. Hogun was confronted by Seth the realm of death and refused to surrender his life, so Seth assaulted Hougun leaving his mark upon him. |||| |||| Thor saved the life of Hogun with a blood transfusion, and then received the news about Asgard’s recent troubles. Earth Force then returned asking to be granted a second chance to show they are not truly evil, and that they were tricked by Seth into attacking Thor. The group traveled to the Vault where they questioned Grog who was being watched by the Black Knight. Grog opened a portal to the realm of Seth in order to escape, but the heroes followed. During the resulting battle, Balder decided that the power of Thor must be brought back to Asgard in order to defend themselves against Seth’s armies, Thor’s powers were siphoned off and given to Balder leaving Thor at the mercy of Grog. It wasn’t long before the rest of the heroes, except for Wind Warrior, were captured. With the heroes in captivity, Seth launched his attack on Asgard. Thor and the others eventually broke free and defeated Grog and his minions, so that they could finally bring the fight to Seth. Grog, fearing for his life, brought the heroes to the Black Pyramid and there Thor released Bes, the Heliopolitan God of luck. Bes revealed Seth’s plan to exterminate all life, and he was able to be so successful because he kept the odds in his favor by using the power of Bes. Wind Warrior, meanwhile, found the rest of the Heliopoiltan gods that had their powers stolen by Seth, and they, too, converged on the Black Pyramid. Yet inside the pyramid, Thor and the others broke into a room where they found the All-Father, Odin, a prisoner. |||| Now with Odin free and with Wind Warrior’s return, Grog returned with reinforcements to begin the battle anew. In Asgard, the Celtic gods led by Leir, Lord of Lightning, acted as reinforcements to help against the legions of Seth. The battle on Asgard took a turn for the worst as it appeared that Balder met his end at the hand of Seth, and with that, all of Thor’s powers were returned to him. Thor and the others made quick work of Grog’s forces, and Thor destroyed the Black Pyramid enraged over Balder’s apparent death. Odin left to aid Asgard just as Surtur, the fire demon, arrived to Seth’s realm looking for him but instead found Thor. |||| Thor used Odin’s power to become as large as Surtur and the two engaged in battle. Odin returned to Asgard just as Seth’s armies were about to emerge victorious and inspired his forces to fight back once more. Earth Force attacked Seth but were ultimately defeated and left to die. Seth transformed himself into a giant serpent and attacked Odin while the blood curse of the Black Knight paralyzed him and his body became as stiff a statue. Upon seeing his son in battle with Surtur, Odin became distracted and Seth gained the upper hand. Hogun attacked Seth so that he would leave Odin and follow him, but in doing so Seth sealed his fate. Hogun used the body of the Black Knight to mortally wound Seth, and his serpent form shrank down into nothingness leaving Asgard and its allies triumphant. Thor defeated Surtur and Odin imprisoned the fire demon within himself, and the Egyptian gods used their powers to heal Earth Force and send them back to Earth with their powers intact. |||| |||| Seth reemerged, with a new look and both hands undamaged, in an underwater base beneath the Hudson River which he called his Armageddon Complex. The psychotic vigilante, Bloodaxe was the first to uncover his base, and he was also the first to be defeated at the hands of Seth. After his defeat, he called for help from his enemy Thunderstrike and together they confronted Seth in his underwater base. Seth revealed his plans to make genetically engineered troops and exploit mankind as he saw fit. Bloodaxe and Thunderstrike attacked the death god, but they were no match for his power, and Seth placed the mark of death upon Thunderstrike’s chest. If not for the timely intervention of Stellaris, Thunderstrike may have perished in the initial attack. After Thunderstrike flooded Seth’s Armageddon Complex, Seth was forced to use his mobile underwater transport as a base. Seth was also visited by the disembodied spirit of Loki looking to make a deal. In exchange for a genetically engineered body for his spirit to reside in, Loki would help the death god dispose of Thunderstrike. Seth readily agreed, and made a new body for the god of mischief. Loki intended to keep his part of the bargain as he tried to trick She-Hulk into killing Thunderstrike, but when Ant-Man and War Machine arrived on the scene, Loki was the one who was bested. Later at a newly constructed base, Thunderstrike, now with the power of his mace and the Executioner’s axe, paid a visit to Seth. Seth tried to seduce Thunderstrike into joining him, but it didn't work. The two of them battled furiously, but it ended when Thunderstrike used the combined powers of the mace and axe to seemingly kill the death god. |||| |||| Recently, Seth tried to recruit followers in the forms of Black Spectre, Bushman and Morpheus in order to strike at his enemy, the moon god Khonshu. However, a newly resurrected Moon Knight stood in his way. Seth, in the guise of a statue of Set, would lash out at Moon Knight in his dreams and even came to life when the ebony energy of Morpheus struck the statue. In the end, Morpheus was defeated by Moon Knight and the statue of Set was destroyed. |||| |||| The god of death has not been seen since."

He rants about the damage done to the plant world by humanity, and attempts to take revenge for this.

However, he was foiled when the Swamp Thing pointed out that this attempt was in fact devastating the plants since killing all the oxygen breathers would mean cutting off the production of carbon dioxide that plants need to live. |||| |||| He fights the Atom on several occasions and was a member of one of the incarnations of the Injustice Gang. |||| |||| The Floronic Man was briefly a hero, after the events of Millennium led to him becoming a member of the New Guardians. After the death of most of his teammates, he seems to have reverted to his original status as a villain. |||| |||| The character has appeared in various other comics and storylines: in a recent issue of Batman he was killed after assassins shot him repeatedly with bullets, although this is in direct contrast to his most famous appearance, in which he pointed out that 'you can't kill a vegetable by shooting it through the head'.

He can also hover or fly silently by means of anti-gravity generators, maintain internal temperature to radiate great amounts of heat or cold through his hands, and can channel electrical energy through his circuits and release it at a touch. He has a pair of modified .357 Magnum pistols installed in his index fingers, which has since been revealed as only part of an arsenal that includes a gas chromatograph, a laser interferometer, micro-pulse radar, an audiometer, a seismometer, a gravity wave detector, a pulse-code modulator, standard computer input/outputs, a radio beacon, an all-wave radio transceiver, and a laser cutting torch/ weapon. X-51 is highly dependant on solar receptors for energy, and if not exposed to light, he will shut down.",,"The robot X-51 was created from a top-secret U.S. military project that hoped to make a robot soldier that could think like a man. 51 experimental robots were engineered, but Dr. Abel Stack, computer heuristics programming specialist, knew that the robot could only think like a man if he was treated as one. He stole the 51st robot and began treating him as if he were his own son, calling him Machine Man and even creating an artificial face for him from simulated flesh and hair. Dr. Stack was proven correct: the other 50 robots began experiencing severe personality defects and were deemed too dangerous; the government ordered that the robots’ self-destruct mechanisms be activated. Unfortunately, in the process of removing Machine Man’s self-destruct, Dr. Stack himself was killed when it went off. |||| |||| Vowing to fulfill Dr. Stack's dream, Machine Man adopted a human identity, Aaron Stack, and tried to find his place in the world of human beings. He eventually met psychiatrist Peter Spaulding and mechanic 'Gears' Garyin, who would become his friends. He worked for a time as an insurance investigator for the Delmar Insurance Company, although his employer and fellow employees were unaware he was a robot. |||| |||| Machine Man fought to preserve himself in a world that feared the machine, especially against Senator Miles Brickman and the costumed villain Madame Menace. The U.S. government attempted to hunt down Aaron, but eventually pardoned him after he stopped one of the Hulk’s rampages. |||| |||| On a later adventure, he met and fell in love with the robot Jocasta, but she was destroyed in battle with her creator Ultron. Later still, Machine Man was contacted by the robot Super-Adaptoid in joining Heavy Metal, a team of robots in order to fight the heroes known as the Avengers, although he then aided the Avengers in their fight against the Adaptoid. |||| |||| Machine Man later aided the Avengers again, this time against the threat of the alien known as Terminus. At the time, the robot had acquired the head of Jocasta, which had been recovered and lost by agents of the villainous High Evolutionary. In the course of this battle, Machine Man narrowly avoided a confrontation with Madame Menace, who ultimately ended up with the Jocasta head. Machine Man again aided the Avengers West Coast branch, being accepted as one of their member so he could join them in the fight against the villains Doctor Demonicus and the Pacific Overlords. As a provisional member of the Avengers, he joined them on a couple more adventures, and was peripherally involved in the battle between the villain Graviton and the heroes of the Thunderbolts. |||| |||| After several months, Machine Man was then captured by the international espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. who wanted to use his technology to further the creation of the new Deathlok cyborg. At the same time, the villainous Red Skull captured the techno-organic being Douglock and took over the SHIELD's Helicarrier transport. Machine Man assisted the heroes of the X-Men in rescuing Douglock and the SHIELD agents trapped onboard, seemingly at the cost of his own life. |||| |||| However, the evil mutant team called the Brotherhood recovered what was left of Machine Man and captured SHIELD Agent Jack Kubrick who was also searching for the robot. After discovering the remains, Brotherhood members Mimic, Blob, Mystique, Toad, and Post were attacked by the recently resurrected Machine Man. During the battle Post shot and seemingly killed Kubrick, but the agent merged with Machine Man`s head and claimed that he was, in fact, X-51 in a new body. As X-51, he discovered his new body contained microscopic nanotech machines called 'nanites' that could repair any damage instantly. X-51 also found that his new programming included remnants of mutant-hunting Sentinel programming, and thus felt compelled to attack and destroy any mutants that he came into contact with. He immediately tried to destroy the Brotherhood and then, afterward, Sebastian Shaw of Shaw Industries and the world-dominating Hellfire Club. When he sought the Avengers for help, he attacked their newest members Justice and Firestar before retreating. |||| |||| X-51 recognized his internal systems were somehow affected and he sought help from his friends in the past, Peter Spaulding and his wife, Jill. The two tried to help the robot but X-51 had become targeted by the Sentinels, the same mutant-hunting machines that had corrupted his systems. The fight between X-51 and the Sentinels threatened to destroy the town if not for the timely arrival of the X-Men. Unfortunately, during the fight, the Sentinels' technology overwhelmed X-51, and he turned on the X-Men. The X-Men battled X-51 until he experienced a moment of mental clarity. In his final act of heroism, X-51, unbeknownst to the X-Men, willingly gave up his own life to stop the battle, allowing his robotic body to explode. |||| |||| At the same time, the United States government had deemed X-51 a threat and ordered Jack Kubrick, agent of the Commission on Superhuman Activities, to investigate. Kubrick was presumably assigned the case because X-51 had been using his identity since presumably merging with Kubrick during X-51's encounter with the mutant Brotherhood. It seemed that the Kubrick absorbed by X-51 was in fact an android (a Life Model Decoy.) The real agent Kubrick investigated the circumstances of X-51's death and returned to the Commission with his report. |||| |||| In fact, X-51 did not truly perish. The nanotechnology in his system rebuilt his body, this time free of Sentinel technology, as well as his mind. X-51's memories were lost, except for those of his father, which he purposefully retained. X-51 began wandering the country, but he soon encountered an alien monolith.

Stripped of his awards and livelihood, Garrett sought new direction in the Triune Understanding, a philosophical movement that preaches the fulfillment of one's innate potential by balancing various aspects of environment and self. Developing a superhuman triple-powered physique, Garrett believed the Triune teachings had unlocked his latent powers, and he became the costumed hero Triathlon while serving as a celebrity spokesman for the Triune Understanding. Aiding the Avengers against Moses Magnum, Triathlon worked well with the group, but tensions arose after unscrupulous Triune leader Jonathan Tremont began a secret smear campaign against the Avengers as part of a Triune publicity ploy, painting the Avengers as religiously intolerant and racially biased. |||| |||| |||| Unaware of Tremont's true nature and secret plans, Delroy began to believe that the increasingly hostile Avengers might be intolerant, even racist; but the feud came to an unexpected end when the Avengers' government liaison Duane Freeman-another Triune follower-convinced the Avengers to recruit Triathlon, since he was a capable hero whose visible minority status and Triune background would help defuse much of the group's negative publicity. Determined to prove the Avengers wrong about the Triunes, Triathlon joined the team. Wary of his fellow Avengers and resenting the circumstances of his recruitment, Delroy was a bitter and disruptive presence at first; but he gradually became a valued and enthusiastic Avenger, thanks in part to advice and support from Warbird and Pulsar. |||| |||| |||| Teaming with Tremont to confront the cosmic menace known as the Triple-Evil, the Avengers learned that Tremont had founded the Triunes to face the Triple-Evil; that he had smeared the Avengers' reputation as part of his efforts to amass Triune influence; that only three scattered cosmic energy shards formed by the universe as 'cosmic antibodies' could neutralize the Triple-Evil; and that two of these shards had come to Earth, where one empowered the 3-D Man (a triple-powered 1950s hero formed by the merger of brothers Hal and Chuck Chandler) and another empowered Tremont, who secretly captured 3-D Man in recent times and merged him into unwitting Triune follower Delroy. Having found the third energy shard in space while facing the Triple-Evil, Tremont tried to take all three shards for himself, but Delroy-still merged with the now-conscious Chandlers-absorbed all three shards. |||| |||| |||| With his newly cosmic power, Triathlon banished the Triple-Evil and helped liberate Earth from Kang; he then gave up his cosmic powers-which had been fuelled by the souls of the Triple-Evil's countless victims-and used the last of his cosmic energy to restore the Chandlers to their separate human forms, regaining his own normal form in the process. Declining to participate in the Triunes' reorganization after Tremont's death in battle with the forces of Kang, Triathlon soon left the Avengers as well, though he has returned to aid them against threats such as Scorpio and an insane Scarlet Witch."
478,Poison Ivy (DC)(Pamela Isley),Pamela Lillian Isley ,478_20070303090432_char.jpg,,,"Poison Ivy (Dr. Pamela Lillian Isley) is a fictional character, a DC Comics supervillainess who is primarily an enemy of Batman. Created by Robert Kanigher and Sheldon Moldoff, she first appeared in Batman #181 (June 1966).[1] |||| |||| Poison Ivy is depicted as one of the world's most prominent eco-terrorists. She is obsessed with plants, botany, and environmentalism. She uses toxins from plants and mind controlling pheromones for her criminal activities, which are usually aimed at protecting the natural environment. Fellow villain Harley Quinn became her recurring partner-in-crime and possibly her only human friend. She has proven to be one of Batman's more powerful foes, being one of the few members of his Rogues Gallery to display anything close to superpowers. Pamela Isley a.k.a. Poison Ivy has been portrayed as a love interest for Batman in some comics. In one comic, Ivy was robbing a charity gala Bruce Wayne was attending. Ivy's first kiss was poison, the second its antidote. When they first meet, Ivy's toxic lips planted a seed of toxic rapture in Bruce. But when she later kissed a dying Dark Knight, Ivy unknowingly cured her intended victim and established a budding romantic tension between them. |||| |||| Creator Robert Kanigher modeled Poison Ivy after Bettie Page, giving her the same haircut and Southern drawl as Page. In her first appearances in 1966, no origin was developed; she was merely a temptress. When she first arrived in Gotham City, her costume was a one-piece, strapless green bathing suit, covered with leaves. Leaves also formed her bracelets, necklace and crown. She wore green high heels and yellow-green nylon stockings with leaves painted on them. These particulars changed somewhat when she re-appeared. |||| |||| Poison Ivy was promoted after the rise of feminism pointed out the need for a greater number of more independent female villains in the series. She was also used to replace the increasingly sympathetic Catwoman as a clearly antagonistic female supervillain foil for Batman, and then made further appearances in the Batman comic book series and in Suicide Squad. The second, retconned origin story provided for her by Neil Gaiman in the late 1980s linked her to Swamp Thing and his original Black Orchid as a human-plant hybrid. She has since appeared in starring roles in Gotham City Sirens and Birds of Prey. |||| |||| In the 1997 film, Batman & Robin, she was portrayed by Uma Thurman. Poison Ivy has been featured in the television series, Batman: The Animated Series and The Batman, brought to life by voice actresses Diane Pershing and Piera Coppola respectively. She is significantly younger on The Batman than in any of her other incarnations – a teenager in fact, who nevertheless proves to be one of the most powerful criminals in the world. |||| |||| IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Poison Ivy as #64.[2] She was ranked 21st in Comics Buyer's Guide's '100 Sexiest Women in Comics' list.[3] |||| |||| from Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_Ivy_(comics)"

Horton for scientific purposes. At a press-conference unveiling, however, Horton's creation burst into flames when exposed to oxygen, and, with human-like sentience, personality, and awareness, rebelled against his creator. Public outcry led to the Torch's being sealed in concrete, which Horton did until he could find a way to control the android's flames, though he eventually escaped due to a crack that let oxygen seep in. While the Torch then inadvertently caused parts of New York City to burn, he eventually learned to control his flame and vowed to help humanity. |||| |||| He would join other heroes as war broke out in Europe, and later in the Pacific, to fight the Axis powers. During this time he acquired a young partner, Thomas 'Toro' Raymond. Toro was the mutant son of two nuclear scientists whose exposure to radiation gave him the ability to control fire. The Human Torch also joined the police force as part of his 'human cover' under the name Jim Hammond. He would later drop the human name and serve the police force outright as the Human Torch, fighting villains and his off-and-on foe, the Sub-Mariner. During World War II Jim helped allied forces and the Invaders fight the Axis powers. Near the end of the war, Jim came face-to-face with Adolf Hitler and killed him with his bare hands. |||| |||| After the war the Torch was placed in deactivation sleep in the Mojave Desert; an atomic bomb test awoke him. Learning that Toro had been captured by the Soviets and brainwashed, the Torch rescued his old partner and learned that the nuclear bomb's radiation had made his powers both much stronger and more unstable. Eventually, fearing he would become a danger to those around him, the Torch flew back out into the desert and went nova, using up his energy reserve and effectively deactivating himself. The Mad Thinker later rebuilt the Torch, restraining his flame and editing his memory so he would forget having been a hero, then sent him after the Fantastic Four. Jim soon fought with the new Human Torch at the Thinker's behest, though he was loathe to actually murder him. But the rest of the four soon appeared, along with Wyatt Wingfoot, and captured him, transporting him back to the Thinker's lab with Lockjaw's help. There, the original Torch rebelled against the Thinker, refusing to be a party to murder, and the Thinker used his computer, Quasimodo, to fire a ray that shut off the invisible coating of protective nitrogen cells, which kept his flame in check, and he burned himself out. A duplicate of his body was later created by the time traveler Immortus; this copy was obtained by the villainous robot Ultron, who used it to create the Vision, an android who went on to join the Avengers |||| |||| The Torch was revived again by the Scarlet Witch â€” who was searching for answers about her husband, the Vision â€” and Ann Raymond, widow of Tom 'Toro' Raymond. He served the Avengers for a while before losing his powers to save the former superheroine Spitfire. His powers gone, he decided to settle down with Ann Raymond. He became the CEO of Oracle, Inc., a company run by Prince Namor. From there, he served as 'boss' to the mercenary group Heroes for Hire, while being secretly manipulated by the Master of the World. When the group disbanded, he went off on his own, before being asked to become the head of V-Battalion upon the retirement of Roger Aubrey, the Destroyer. |||| |||| Recently, while on leave from the V-Battalion and working with the new Invaders, he became attached to Tara, a recently-constructed female android based on him, whom he came to regard as a daughter of sorts. He also struck up a renewed acquaintance with Spitfire to the dismay of her beau, the current Union Jack, while beginning to show signs that his powers were regenerating. |||| Unfortunately, Tara was revealed to be a plant, created by the Red Skull, with overrides on her developing personality allowing the Invaders' enemies, the Axis Mundi, to use her as a weapon against the team. Refusing to believe that she was truly gone, he found himself able to flame on again, and tried to channel the heat from her system to shut her down before she overloaded and killed all the Invaders, herself included. While he was able to stop her meltdown, his own systems could not handle the sheer heat, and he flew high into the atmosphere before detonating. |||| |||| Captain America makes him an agent of SHIELD in All-New Invaders #5."

317,Hobgoblin (Marvel)(02 - Roderick Kingsley),Roderick Kingsley. ,317_20060421232322_char.jpg,"In the beginning of his career Kingsley had no superhuman abilities, but possessed a keen analytical intellect with enough knowledge of chemistry and biology to understand the notes of Norman Osborn regarding the Green Goblin Formula and other inventions to the extent that Kingsley was eventually able to complete Norman's work and even improved many of Osborn's various inventions. He also had expertise in areas outside of the original Green Goblin's knowledge. Kingsley was a master of hypnosis and drug induced mind control. Kingsley was highly skilled in the management of both criminal organizations and legally run professional businesses. He was also a talented fashion designer. |||| |||| Due to the green chemical that he bathed in, Kingsley possesses superhuman strength similar to that of Spider-Man. His reflexes, speed, and stamina are also enhanced to superhuman levels, as well as his intelligence, but at an extraordinary level. He was actually physically stronger than the original Green Goblin in the beginning, because of longer exposure to the formula. The derivative of the Green Goblin formula Kingsley used did not apparently drive him as insane as the original formula did to Norman Osborn, thanks to some certain modifications, though both Kingsley and his brother did at times worry that he had indeed developed insanity. |||| |||| He is armed with a variety of bizarre incendiary devices and uses a Goblin Glider as a personal transport. It can reach high velocities and is extremely maneuverable.",,"The original Hobgoblin, Roderick Kingsley, was an enemy of Spider-Man and for a large portion of his criminal career, he initially had no superhuman powers, though he did acquire them later. Of all of Spider-Man's enemies who tried to adopt Norman Osborn's legacy, only Kingsley came close to being as threatening and dangerous as the original Green Goblin. He wore a variant of the Green Goblin's costume distinguished by a hood, cape and a different color scheme. |||| |||| Upon examining the lair and gleaning the secrets within it, Kingsley decided to adopt the legacy of the Green Goblin almost in its entirety. Using the Green Goblin's equipment, Kingsley adopted the identity of the Hobgoblin (which should not be confused with the second Green Goblin who was Harry Osborn). His activities included using some of Norman Osborn's files on prominent figures to blackmail them, and attempting to buy Osborn's old corporation and merge it with his own. These schemes inevitably brought him into conflict with Spider-Man. Kingsley perceived Spider-Man as a nuisance and sought to eliminate him almost as an afterthought, rather than a principal goal. Kingsley also found among Norman's notes incomplete remnants of the strength enhancing potion of Norman Osborn. He became obsessed with finding the complete formula or perfecting the incomplete notes. In his various criminal activities Kingsley repeatedly lost to the web-slinger, as he lacked the raw physical power of Spider-Man. |||| |||| Persistent and extremely intelligent, Kingsley eventually recovered the strength-enhancing potion he sought. Being well aware that the formula had driven Osborn insane, Kingsley was not about to try it until he had tested it on someone else. He tricked a small-time hood in his employ, Lefty Donovan, into administering the formula and then used mind control to force Donovan to fight Spider-Man in the Hobgoblin costume. From a distance, Kingsley carefully monitored Donovan's vital signs and behavior. When Spider-Man overwhelmed and unmasked Donovan, and his brainwashing begin to fail, Kingsley acted quickly to protect his identity by programming Donovan's glider to crash, instantly killing him. Though Donovan's tenure as a Hobgoblin was brief, he is considered the second Hobgoblin. Judging that the experiment was a success, Kingsley then immersed himself in his completed derivative of the Goblin formula and gained slightly greater strength than even the original Green Goblin had. |||| |||| Now that he had become a physical match for Spider-Man, the Hobgoblin became more ambitious in his villainy. Despite his increased abilities, he was still narrowly defeated by Spider-Man. Worse still, he seemed to have attracted the attention of powerful criminal interests who perceived him as a threat, among these the infamous Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin of Crime. After a bitter encounter with Spider-Man, Kingsley discovered he had been followed by Daily Bugle reporter Ned Leeds, who had discovered his lair. Kingsley carefully brainwashed Ned Leeds with hypnosis and hallucinogenics into becoming the third Hobgoblin, who acted in concert with Kingsley. Though Leeds lacked superhuman strength, he was effective in his role due to his investigative skills (in fact, he was more effective than the Hobgoblin IV after he had acquired superhuman abilities). Kingsley also discovered that Leeds had been working with the Kingpin's son, Richard Fisk, on a plan to bring down the Kingpin and his empire. Richard Fisk had now adopted the identity of the Rose and posed as a crimelord. Kingsley used Leeds to handle some of the negotiations, fooling many into believing that Leeds was the Hobgoblin. He hoped to use the Kingpin's downfall as an opportunity to advance his own interests."

Nightside can utilize this energy for a variety of purposes, including enshrouding her opponents in a cloak of darkness, displace projectile attacks against her person by opening small apertures into the Darkforce dimension, and cause beings and objects to be engulfed by the Darkforce, thus plunging them into the nightmarish void that is the Darkforce realm.",,"Nightside is a member of the Imperial Guard, a multi-ethnic group of super-powered alien beings who act as enforcers of the laws of the Shi'ar Empire. She was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix Lilandra from her insane brother, then-Majestor D'Ken. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor. |||| |||| Nightside was later amongst those few Imperial Guard members who opposed the treacherous Shi'ar High Council member Lord Samédàr who was aiding an attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by Deathbird. Even after many of the Guard chose to side with Samédàr, Nightside remained steadfast in her loyalty to then-Empress Lilandra. |||| |||| Later, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne, Nightside was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as Excalibur and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named Rachel Summers. |||| |||| During the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires, Nightside was part of a small team of Guardsmen who were charged with preventing the member of the Earth team of super-powered beings known as the Avengers named Quasar from retrieving the legendary Nega-Bands of the Kree warrior Captain Mar-vell, which had been stolen. |||| |||| When the Empress Lilandra, having regained her throne, learned of the many Earth heroes that had sacrificed their lives to stop the malevolent psionic being named Onslaught, she dispatched eight members of the Imperial Guard, including Nightside, to protect Earth. While on Earth, the Guard uncovered a plot by a militant Kree faction to simulate a radical political activist group in revenge for Earth's involvement in the Kree/Shi'ar war. In reality, the group created a 'nega-reactor', similar to the bomb that was used on the Kree. However, this plot was stopped by the Guard, but not before the reactor was used by the Kree's leader, the Supreme Intelligence, to re-incorporate itself after being presumably killed at the end of the war. |||| |||| Subsequently, Nightside was amongst those Imperial Guard members who defended Lilandra against an assassination attempt by the Kree Ronan the Accuser and his unwilling agents, the royal family of the Earth race known as the Inhumans. ||||"

Eternity's humanoid form is an artifical manifestation and cannot be perceived unless he wishes to make contact with a humanoid.",,"Eternity came into existence when the universe was formed (along with Galactus, Death, Oblivion, and Infinity) and spontaneously assumed the collective consciousness of all living things in the Universe. He is every living thing and every living thing is him; thus he controls everything in all plains of existence with the exception of the Living Tribunal, who maintains the cosmic balance of power. Eternity is the physical incarnation of time, whereas his sister Infinity represents space. Also, if Galactus ever dies or does not exist, the opposite of Eternity, Abraxas, would come into being. Eternity is guarded by Captain Universe. (taken from an old copy of the Handbook of the Marvel Universe): The origin and precise nature of the abstract being known as Eternity are unknown and unknowable. It is the sum total of collective consciousness of all living things in the universe, the embodiment of their life as Death is the embodiment of the ending of that life. Unlike Death, which Eternity refers to as it's sibling, Eternity does not often take an active hand in the dealings of the trillions of lives that make up it's total. However, since controlling the being Eternity allows the controller to wield Eternity's unlimited Powers over the beings that make it up, this entity is a target for extradimensional attackers of various abilities. Usually Eternity can deflect such attacks without significant exertion, but on occasion has had to bring it's own servants into play. While not as organized as the 'death-gods' that serve Death, these servants are usually powerful individuals, such as Doctor Strange, who may combat the attackers on their own mortal levels.

He came into control of the Thunderbolt, essentially a genie, who had to grant any wish he had.  Unfortunately, he had no command of the English language.  Most of his stories revolved around his attempts to find just the right way to phrase his requests.  Usually, he did a fair amount of destruction, before finding the words to make everything better.  When he was able to be clear, though, he was able to summon one of the most powerful forces in the DCU, capable of things that Superman could literally only dream of. |||| |||| He was forced to resign from the original JSA when his power over the Thunderbolt was greatly diminished by the High Priest of Badhnisia--ruler of the plane on which the Thunderbolt resided.  For a time, the Bolt was answering only 1/4th of his requests.  He gave his place in the JSA to Black Canary. |||| |||| Eventually the High Priest's plans were laid bare, and it became apparent that he intended to rule Badhinisia.  Casting several powerful spells to protect him from the Thunderbolt, Johnny eventually lost almost all control over the Thunderbolt.  He was able to issue one final request, though, and sent the Bolt to get Superman.  Superman (I) and his wife, Lois, were able to overcome the High Priest, and Johnny decided to remain in Badhnisia to teach its people about democracy. |||| |||| Only when that mission was complete did he return home. |||| |||| During the Silver Age, he popped up with some frequency, and tended to be seen more often on Earth 1 than not, as traveling between the two Earths was easier for him than any other character in the DCU. |||| |||| He lived through the Crisis , but was effectively retired in Badhnisia thereafter.  Eventually, after the new JSA was formed, he was aged to a point of senility and basically died.  Having found the pen in which the Thunderbolt was kept, and thus coming to be the Thunderbolt's new 'master',  Jakeem Thunder requested of his Thunderbolt that Johnny be revived.  He was, but the Bolt wasn't quite able to do it as straightforwardly as Jakeem might have wanted.  He fused Johnny and his Thunderbolt into one entity, creating Johnny Thunderbolt.  This character, restored to youth, but with a more mature personality, survives, mostly in Badhnisia, to this day.  (In a 2005 JSA arc, however, it appeared that Johnny and his Thunderbolt had gotten a 'divorce', but a full explanation has yet to be revealed.)"

211,Scarlet Witch (Marvel)(02 - Wanda Maximoff),Wanda Maximoff ,211_20090826043837_char.jpg,"Initially, the Scarlet Witch had the ability to manipulate probability via her 'hexes' (often manifesting physically as 'hex spheres' or 'hex bolts'). These hexes are relatively short range, and are limited to her line of sight. Casting a hex requires a gesture and concentration on her part, though the gestures are largely a focus for the concentration. Early in her career, her hexes were unconscious on her part, and would be automatically triggered whenever she made a particular gesture, regardless of her intent. These hexes would only manifest 'bad luck' effects. She later gained enough control over her powers that her powers only work when she wants them to, and they are not limited to negative effects. Despite this enhanced precision, her hexes are not necessarily guaranteed to work, particularly if she has been straining herself or using her powers excessively. If overextended, her hexes can backfire, causing probability to work against her wishes or to undo previous hexes. |||| |||| Her hexes have a wide, almost limitless variety of recorded and possible effects, though they often boil down to a kind of Deus Ex Machina superpower. They have been known to alter the molecular composition and physical state of physical objects, negate or distort physical laws, and to cause various forms of energy to spontaneously appear or disappear. She has a natural affinity with natural elements and phenomena, stemming largely from her magical training and origins, and has trained often at using her hexes to deflect projectiles or to cause enemies to stumble or otherwise suffer the effects of 'bad luck'. Writers often confuse her hex powers with psychokinesis, and have occasionally depicted them as able to generate energy blasts and to grant Wanda the power of flight. Although her hexes can cause objects to suddenly move or change course, they do not have the ability to 'hold on' to objects as a telekinetic might. Ultimately, the hexes are not under the Witch's direct control, although she can influence the nature of their effects with great concentration and effort. This makes her one of the few Avengers that Ultron fears; his adamantium shell cannot repel magic. She has displayed the ability to cancel Longshot and Domino's powers of probability and has also once turned Longshot into a cat. |||| |||| The first major reclassification of Wanda's fairly-indistinct hex powers came during Kurt Busiek's run on Avengers, where her mutant power was claimed by Agatha Harkness to be an ability to manipulate chaos magic, given to her by the demon Chthon (imprisoned within Wundagore Mountain) when she was born. Her hexes were, by extension, simple, indirect manifestations of this magic, destabilising probabilities by inducing chaos. Across Busiek's run, Wanda's powers grew continuously, as she gained the ability to manipulate organic matter and summon Wonder Man back to life. While in the DC Universe, she displayed the ability to access that universe's chaos magic, but had great difficulty in doing so at first, since it was more powerful there and she had no previous experience in wielding it. |||| |||| The second, current redefinition of Wanda's powers came during the Avengers Disassembled crossover event, where they were revealed to be an ability to manipulate reality. Her probability-manipulating hexes have been redefined as the conscious manifestation of this subconscious power. The idea that Wanda possessed this level of power was first suggested by Immortus during his conflict with the Avengers West Coast, although Immortus specifically claimed that Wanda could manipulate the past to influence the present. Her powers were used by Morgan Le Fey to alter reality in Avengers (volume 3) #1-3, although this was only accomplished with magical amplification. It was in Avengers Disassemled that the full extent of this power came to light, when it was revealed that Wanda had been subconsciously altering the Marvel Universe to an unknown degree for a number of years, including the reanimation of the deceased Agatha Harkness without consciously realizing it to be the case (which goes some way to retconning away the previous 'chaos magic' origin, as it was not truly Agatha who explained it, while Dr. Strange's claim that chaos magic does not exist, is contradicted by but one brief moment when he himself has employed it in the past, in a fill-in issue, during an era where he was using 'catastrophe magic'.)This retconning has caused much debate and disgust in the comic fandom recently. |||| |||| This aspect of her power is not under her conscious control, and continues even after Dr. Strange shut down her mind. There doesn't seem to be any limits to her powers as she was easily able to alter the entire 616 reality to create the House of M, and is also altering reality on a multiversal scale without even realizing it! |||| |||| The source of Wanda's reality manipulation powers is due to the fact that her mutation allows her to tap into magic.

His mother died in childbirth, earning him the enduring hatred of his adopted elder brother, Hunter, who also resented T'Challa for supplanting him in the royal household. Hunter would become the White Wolf, leader of the Hatut Zeraze (Dogs of War), the Wakandan secret police. Their father T'Chaka remarried, but his second wife, Ramonda, seemingly ran away with another man when T'Challa was eight. When T'Challa was a teenager, T'Chaka was murdered by Klaw, a Dutchman seeking to plunder the rare Vibranium metal unique to Wakanda, but T'Challa used Klaw's own weapon to maim him and drive him off. T'Challa studied in Europe and America, then underwent ritual trials in Wakanda - including defeating his uncle S'yan, the existing Black Panther - to win the heart-shaped herb, enhancing his abilities and linking him spiritually to the Panther God Bast. Now Wakanda's ruler as the Black Panther, he disbanded and exiled the Hatut Zeraze and continued transforming his country into a high-tech wonderland. When tribal war broke out, T'Challa restored peace by condemning the Jabari tribe, and by picking Dora Milaje ('Adored Ones') from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives-in-training. |||| |||| Taught by his father to think two steps ahead of enemies and three steps ahead of friends, T'Challa saw the world's super-beings as potential threats to Wakanda. Inviting the Fantastic Four to visit him, he forced them into a series of tests, then allied with them against a returning Klaw. He also joined the American-based Avengers to spy on them from within, but soon came to regard them as true friends and staunch allies. He adopted the identity of teacher Luke Charles while in America, romancing singer Monica Lynne, later his fiancée. Dividing his time between Wakanda and America for years, he battled foes such as Jabari malcontent M'Baku the Man-Ape, rebel leader Erik Killmonger, the snake-charmer Venomm (later an ally), voodoo charlatan Baron Macabre, the Ku Klux Klan, the ghostly Soul-Strangler, the soaring Wind Eagle, mutated drug czar Solomon Prey, arms dealer Moses Magnum and the Supremacists of Azania. He also fought Kiber the Cruel during a quest for the mystic time-shifting artifacts known as King Solomon's Frogs; these produced an alternate version of T'Challa from a future ten years hence, a merry telepathic Panther with a terminal brain aneurysm. Placing his dying future self in cryogenic storage, T'Challa broke off his engagement with Monica since he feared he had no future to give her. Wakanda and Atlantis subsequently came to the brink of war during the Kiber Island incident, which revealed Wakanda to be a nuclear power. Discovering his stepmother Ramonda had not run away, but instead had been kidnapped by Anton Pretorius, he rescued her from years of captivity in South Africa. T'Challa joined the Knights of Pendragon against their enemies, the Bane, learning in the process that he housed one of the Pendragon spirits himself. He was also used as a pawn in the efforts of the munitions company Cardinal Technology to escalate the civil war in the northern nation Mohannda, but exposed Cardinal with the aid of the mercenary Black Axe and the anti-war activist Afrikaa. |||| |||| T'Challa's restrictions on exports of both Vibranium and Wakandan technology had long annoyed foreign powers. Xcon, an alliance of rogue intelligence agents and the Russian mafia, backed a coup in Wakanda led by Reverend Achebe. Learning Achebe was empowered by the demon Mephisto, T'Challa sold his soul in exchange for Mephisto's, abandoning Achebe and leaving Wakanda in peace; however, T'Challa's unity with the Panther God and its link to the spirits of past Panther Clan leaders forced Mephisto to forfeit the Panther's soul. T'Challa then presented the U.N. with evidence of the Xcon plot and its U.S. links, demanding sanctions against America. When Hunter and the Hatut Zeraze resurfaced during the Xcon incident, a wary T'Challa imprisoned them just prior to regaining his throne. |||| |||| After T'Challa discharged Nakia from the Dora Milaje for trying to kill Monica Lynne in a fit of jealousy, Nakia was tortured by Achebe and rehabilitated by Killmonger, who shaped her into the mad warrior Malice. She was replaced in the Dora Milaje by Queen Divine Justice, an American-raised Jabari. T'Challa himself returned to the U.S. on a diplomatic mission, leaving his Washington envoy Everett K. Ross in charge as regent of Wakanda, until Killmonger tried to destroy Wakanda's economy; to thwart this, the Panther nationalized all foreign companies in Wakanda, causing a global run on the stock market, which Tony Stark (Iron Man) used to secure a controlling interest in the Wakandan Design Group. Returning home, the Panther fought Killmonger in ritual combat, but was distracted at a critical juncture by Ross and beaten nearly to death. Killmonger only relented when Ross, still regent, yielded on T'Challa's behalf, unwittingly giving the Black Panther title to Killmonger. T'Challa's life was mystically saved by his allies Brother Voodoo and Moon Knight. While T'Challa recovered, Killmonger tried to join the Avengers as the new Black Panther, and Achebe enlisted super-mercenaries such as Deadpool to attack Wakanda again. During the resultant Avengers visit to Wakanda, Ross freed Hunter, whose scheming resulted in Killmonger's seeming demise and the restoration of T'Challa's title. |||| |||| Wakanda next came into conflict with Deviant Lemuria during a dispute over custody of a Deviant child found in Wakanda. As tensions mounted, warships from Wakanda, the U.S. and Atlantis all entered the area, and Hunter made matters worse when he decided to force T'Challa to 'reclaim his dignity' by reviving Klaw, who tried to spark outright war between the nations involved. In the end, Ross's negotiation skills and information supplied by Magneto and Doctor Doom resolved the conflict. While T'Challa faced attacks by Malice, Divine Justice was kidnapped by the Man-Ape, who learned she was the rightful Queen of his tribe. T'Challa defeated M'Baku again, though not before he uncovered the frozen future Panther. Back in New York, the criminal Nightshade resurrected the fabled Chinese monster Chiantang the Black Dragon to use against T'Challa. Black Dragon had the Panther attacked by a mind-controlled Iron Fist, whose assault caused the brain aneurysm the future Panther had foreshadowed. Nightshade, meanwhile, managed to revive the future Panther. |||| |||| At the same time, T'Challa learned that White Wolf had taken over Xcon and slain most of its leaders, who had used King Solomon's Frogs to replace the U.S. President and Canadian Prime Minister with brainwashed future counterparts, allowing Xcon to secretly take over both countries. Hunter continued their plan and sought revenge on Tony Stark for his buy-out of Wakandan Design Group. Uncertain of how far along Hunter's plan was, T'Challa drew Stark out with a covert message, using financial finagling to seize control of Stark Enterprises and simultaneously annex a small Canadian island in Lake Superior, prompting the U.S. and Canadian leaders to meet to discuss this crisis. The Panther and his allies, including the future Panther, then invaded the White House and foiled Xcon's plot, un-brainwashing the duplicate leaders and returning them to their own times. |||| |||| Panther and his allies returned to Wakanda, where the future Panther fell into a coma. Hoping to free her tribe, Divine Justice freed the Man-Ape, but he broke his promises of non-violence by slaying the helpless future T'Challa. The original T'Challa, by now unstable and hallucinating, attacked the Jabari tribe with the intent of wiping them out; but after nearly slaying Divine Justice, he came to his senses and stopped the battle. Unable to face what he had done, the Panther handed power to his council and hid in New York. There he mentored policeman Kasper Cole (who had adopted an abandoned Panther costume), an experience which gave T'Challa the strength to face his illness, his nation and the world. His rule has since been challenged by a revived Killmonger, an issue which remains unresolved. At the same time, T'Challa renewed his ties with the Avengers, helping them battle Scorpio, secure special United Nations status and unmask U.S. Defense Secretary Dell Rusk as the evil Red Skull; however, the team disbanded after a series of devastating assaults by an insane Scarlet Witch. |||| |||| T'Challa recently fell in love with, and married Ororo Monroe, the mutant X-Man known as Storm."

Finally he sacrificed himself to allow Superman the chance to destroy Mageddon/Tezcatlipoca, during the World War III saga, which ended Grant Morrison's run on JLA."
