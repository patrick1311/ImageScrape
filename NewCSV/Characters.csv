3534,Grim Reaper (Marvel),Eric Williams ,3534_20070125132301_char.jpg,"As a zombie, he had unnatural strength and endurance, and was largely oblivious to pain and injury; he maintained his undead existence by draining the life forces of others through his scythe. After empowerment by Lloigoroth and Blackheart, the Reaper could perform illusion casting, shape-shifting, energy blasts, teleportation, inter-dimensional travel, conjuring/commanding minor demonic creatures, matter restructuring, remote communication, remote surveillance, transmutation, emotion vampirism (feeding off the despair of others) and reanimating the dead as his zombie servants.",,"Supposedly born bad, Eric Williams always defined himself by comparison to his 'good' brother, Simon. Both brothers struggled in vain for the approval of their demanding, abusive father, Sanford; but where Simon was shy and studious, Eric was athletic, wild and reckless. Regarded as the black sheep of the family, Eric became a thief and tried unsuccessfully to pressure Simon into participating in his petty crimes. Secretly admiring Simon's virtue, Eric developed an unrealistically idealized view of his brother, whom he loved and resented in equal measure. Scorning his family's high-tech manufacturing business, Eric became a gambler and a professional criminal, rising within the ranks of the Maggia organized crime cartel. Simon, meanwhile, dutifully entered the family business and took over its management after Sanford's death. Williams Innovations gradually failed, thanks in part to stiff competition from rival firm Stark Industries, and a desperate Simon turned to Eric for help-though Eric's attempted intimidation and coercion of business rivals and potential clients failed to produce useful results. As a last resort, Simon stole money from his own company, hoping to invest it in Eric's Maggia ventures for a fast profit and save the business; but Simon got caught, and was arrested for embezzlement. Unable to accept his brother's fall from grace, Eric lied to his mother and others by claiming that he was the real embezzler, insisting that Simon had merely taken the blame. |||| |||| Simon was transformed into Wonder Man by Baron Heinrich Zemo and used against the Avengers before sacrificing himself to save the heroes, who preserved a copy of his brain patterns in the hope of resurrecting him someday. Learning of Simon's apparent demise, Eric went mad with grief and wrongly blamed the Avengers for Simon's death. He hired the Tinkerer to build him a high-tech miniature arsenal in the form of a scythe, enhancing it with a coma-inducing device created by the mad robot Ultron, a fellow Avengers enemy who became so intrigued by Eric's family-inspired vendetta that he secured a copy of Simon's brain patterns for experimental purposes, later using them to create the android Vision. As the Grim Reaper, Eric very nearly killed the Avengers but was thwarted by the Black Panther. Escaping, the Reaper recruited fellow Avengers foes Living Laser, Man-Ape (M'Baku), Power Man (Erik Josten) and Swordsman (Jacques Duquesne) into the Lethal Legion, whose members competed with each other to see who could capture or kill the most Avengers; but the Legion was soon defeated and imprisoned, thanks largely to a new Avengers recruit, the Vision, whom the Reaper could not bring himself to kill. |||| |||| Stealing and preserving Simon's body, the Reaper offered to transfer Vision's mind into it and make him human in exchange for not opposing Reaper's efforts to destroy the Avengers, though Vision refused. Later, in partnership with a Space Phantom and unwittingly manipulated by Immortus, the Reaper seized control of a faction of the subversive group Hydra and conspired against the Avengers, again tempting Vision with offers of a human body, at one point promising to seize the body of Captain America for this purpose. Vision played along to infiltrate the Reaper's plans but ultimately helped the Avengers defeat the villains, though the Reaper and Vision saved each other's lives in turn during the fight. Captured and imprisoned, Eric eventually escaped and recovered Simon's body, which had actually been in a death-like stasis for years while he mutated into a new form. Once Simon was revived (apparently with the aid of Ultron), the Reaper hired the voodoo master Black Talon (Sam Barone) to send the half-dead hero after the Avengers in a zombie-like state, though Simon soon regained full consciousness and took up residence with the Avengers. Aided in penetrating Avengers security by Ultron, the Reaper imprisoned Vision, Wonder Man and several Avengers, staging a mock trial to determine whether the mutated Wonder Man or the android Vision was truly the real Simon Williams. The Reaper decided in favor of Simon and would have killed Vision, but he was defeated by Wonder Man. |||| |||| Deciding that Wonder Man and Vision were both inhuman mockeries of the true Simon, the Reaper tried unsuccessfully to kill them before enlisting his new lover Nekra and old allies Ultron, Black Talon, Goliath (Josten) and Man-Ape in a bizarre scheme to destroy the Avengers and re-create the 'real' Simon Williams by transferring portions of the minds of Vision and Wonder Man into the voodoo-animated corpse of criminal Brady Kent, which had been surgically altered to duplicate Simon's original human form. The plan failed and the Reaper-having belatedly realized that Vision and Wonder Man were truly his brothers-fell to his death while fleeing in shame. Nekra revived Eric as an unwitting, unusually lifelike zombie, teaming with him and the Brady Kent zombie to assault the hospital where Vision's wife Scarlet Witch was giving birth; but the Reaper fell dead when he broke Nekra's spell by discovering, to his horror, that he was a zombie. A Grim Reaper soon fought the Avengers as part of Immortus's Legion of the Unliving, but whether that was the true Eric Williams or not is unclear. Later, Nekra raised the Reaper again, this time as a zombie who could sustain his existence by draining others' life force with his scythe, an ability he tested by fatally stabbing Nekra. He renewed his partnership with Ultron, but did so in order to subvert Ultron's plans to 'robotize' humanity since this scheme would have deprived the Reaper of human victims; in the end, both villains were captured by the Avengers. Shortly thereafter, the Red Skull used both Reaper and Ultron as part of his mind-controlled army of super-villains in a world conquest scheme involving a giant laser cannon, but the Avengers thwarted this plot. |||| |||| Gaining power from the demonic Old Ones' Lloigoroth, the Reaper caused an airliner crash and captured a commuter train, transforming some of his victims into superhuman zombie facsimiles of deceased Avengers foes, apparently imbuing them with the originals' spirits. Reaper's Legion of the Unliving nearly destroyed the Avengers, but his hold over the zombies broke when Vision forced Eric to admit that he had killed himself and the Avengers were not to blame. The Reaper was seemingly consumed by Lloigoroth for his failure. Later, the Reaper appeared to haunt Simon again as part of a baffling conflict staged by the demons Mephisto and Blackheart, though how much (if any) of this encounter was real remains unclear. When Wonder Man died again and mystically returned in a ghostly state, the barriers between life and death weakened enough for Grim Reaper's spirit to return to the earthly plane, mystically enslaving the spirits of Wonder Man and several other dead Avengers to attack the living Avengers. However, the undead Avengers were freed from the Reaper's control by the Scarlet Witch and turned on the Reaper, helping the living Avengers defeat him. In the end, most of the undead Avengers returned to their respective afterlives, but Wonder Man was fully resurrected through the Witch's magic, which also restored the Grim Reaper to life after he was forced to admit his love for his brother. |||| |||| Since his rebirth, the Reaper has apparently decided to abandon his old obsessions. He has even fought alongside the Avengers twice, aiding them against their common enemies Ultron and Alkhema; however, the Reaper remains a ruthless criminal and has renewed his association with the Maggia, renewing his enmity with the Avengers in the process."

4749,Aleta (Marvel),Aleta Ogord ,4749_20070423181422_char.jpg,"Aleta can create focus photons into solid light constructs (such as battering rams, bubbles, ramps, etc.). She can fly by standing on a disc of her solid light and mentally commanding it to rise upwards. Later she was shown to create more complicated constructions and manipulate them (moving and changing size) which appeared to be a power similar to DC Universe character Green Lantern. She was able to lift things weighting up to 50 tons, as well as increased stamina, durability and agility that are common among Arcturans, When she became Starhawk, Aleta gained the ability to fly at speeds approaching that of light, was able to survive in the vacuum of space, control various forms of energy to fire concussive blasts or create protective shields, and displayed limited precognition. She is able to phase through solid matter by aligning her own molecules in a corresponding pattern to the molecules of the object she is attempting to pass through.",,"Aleta Ogord, an Arcturan, was trained to be aggressive and resented her weak and intellectual adoptive brother Stakar. When she was physically merged with Stakar, such that only one of them could exist physically at any one time, she spent much time suspended in limbo. She grew passive and, in time, fell in love with Stakar. The Hawk God allowed the two to separate for a time, and she gave birth to three children, Tara, Sita, and John. |||| |||| Aleta's father, Ogord, sought revenge on Starhawk for abandoning him, kidnapped his grandchildren, and turned them into psychic vampires. The children were killed, and Aleta held it against Stakar for the rest of his life, as she felt he could have prevented it. |||| |||| Eventually, Aleta and Starhawk were separated, and she began a relationship with Vance Astro until a dying Starhawk reabsorbed her to save his own life. For a time, the merged being existed only in Stakar's newly darkened form, even when Aleta was in control, until Aleta finally overpowered Stakar, sent him back to his infant body in the past, and assumed the mantle of Starhawk. She held the title for a brief period, until Stakar returned during a visit to another timeline, after which she gave up the title and powers of Starhawk to be rid of Stakar's influence, which had made her cold and unfeeling. Alhtough she was still in love with Vance and was engaged to marry him, the series ended leaving the future of their relationship ambiguous."

When subjected to tests at Armbruster International to make her beautiful, she also developed super powers, most formidable of which was her 'swan song', a sonic wave which could cause massive devastation.  At first she worked for Hank Armbruster, but she eventually realised that he was exploiting her and turned against him."
648,Thunderball (Marvel),Dr. Eliot Franklin ,648_20070907020610_char.jpg,"Thunderball shares the Asgardian enchantment originally given to the Wrecker, becoming transformed into a being of superhuman power, slightly less than an Asgardian god. He possesses vast superhuman strength and a high degree of invulnerability with some resistance to cold, heat, fire, corrosives and toxins.",,"Dr. Eliot Franklin was a genius-level physicist, nearly on par with Bruce Banner. He even designed a miniature gamma-ray bomb, a feat that eluded Banner. However, his invention was stolen by an unscrupulous executive at Richmond Enterprises, and Franklin was imprisoned after an attempt to steal it back. While in prison at Ryker’s Island, he met and befriended Dirk Garthwaite, a.k.a. the Wrecker. The Wrecker told his friends of the power he received by Karnilla, the Norn Queen, power enough to take on the thunder god Thor, and they orchestrated an escape. With fellow convicts Henry Camp and Brian Calusky, the group managed to retrieve the crowbar that housed the powers that had been drained from the Wrecker. Grasping the bar in an electrical storm, the Wrecker was restored, Camp became Bulldozer, Calusky became Piledriver, and Franklin became Thunderball. Together, they became known as the Wrecking Crew. |||| Thunderball initiated their first foray into crime, destroying anything associated with Richmond Enterprises in order to capture his gamma bomb and ransom New York. They were stopped by the Defenders, but Thunderball and the Wrecking Crew were never contained for long. |||| |||| But Thunderball had always felt superior to his teammates, knowing his intelligence set him apart. He often parted company with them, and was seen acting independently on several occasions. Once, he sought out his ex-girlfriend, Rhonda Taddington, holding her friend, Clytemnestra Erwin, hostage and running into conflict with her boyfriend, Rhodes, James as Iron Man. He later took it upon himself to retrieve the Wrecking Crew’s weapons from the authorities, running afoul of Spider-Man, who defeated Thunderball by overloading his wrecking ball with electricity and knocking him out. |||| |||| However, if the Wrecking Crew appeared, Thunderball was sure to be seen as well, including in their abduction to Battleworld by the Beyonder and joining with Doctor Doom's army of super-villains. The Crew also joined Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil. After this, Thor used his hammer to draw the Wrecker’s away from the others who divided it, and Thunderball was left powerless. |||| |||| When imprisoned in the Vault, Thunderball participated in a massive breakout but refused to follow the orders of Venom, battling him over the alliances among their cellmates. However, they were trapped inside with a nuclear reactor that threatened to meltdown, and Thunderball was instrumental in defusing the device with Iron Man. |||| |||| Months later, the Wrecker freed his Crew and restored their power once more. As before, wherever the Wrecking Crew was to be found, Thunderball was among their number. They performed many other acts of villainy, although Thunderball grew dissatisfied with the Wrecker’s leadership, coveting all the power of the Crew for himself. Eventually, the Crew reconciled, seeking out Hercules once more. But battling them helped Hercules overcome the fear of combat he had suffered since the beating at their hands, and they were defeated. |||| |||| Once, Thunderball was broken out of prison by Midnight on behalf of the Secret Empire. He served alongside Midnight as their agent, coming into conflict with Midnight’s former mentor, Moon Knight as well as Spider-Man and other heroes, until Midnight was betrayed by the organization and destroyed their headquarters. |||| |||| The Wrecking Crew’s powers began fading when many of Asgard's links to Earth were separated. The entire Crew received a power boost when hired by Arnim Zola to battle the Thunderbolts (unaware that the Thunderbolts included many of their former allies in the Masters of Evil). |||| |||| The Wrecking Crew appeared together for various endeavors: hired by the likes of the Doomsday Man, battling heroes such as the Avengers and the Warriors Three, used as lackeys by Morgan Le Fay, among others. When the Crew was imprisoned in the Raft, they joined the massive breakout and escaped."

3256,Giant-Man (Marvel)(Ultimate)(01 - Hank Pym),Henry Pym ,3256_20080709133244_char.jpg,Giant Man can grow into many times his normal size.,,"In the Ultimate Marvel continuity, Henry 'Hank' Pym is a brilliant, but mentally fragile scientist who takes Prozac and is married to Janet Pym, née van Dyne. He is chosen to work on the 'Super Soldier Project' for S.H.I.E.L.D. under Nick Fury. Hank is also the superhero 'Giant-Man', able to grow to 59 feet and 11 inches (60 feet being the point where the human body cannot support its own mass). He gains his powers after experimenting on the blood of his wife Jan, who is a mutant. |||| |||| In this continuity, he is prone to domestic violence, a spin off of a storyline in traditional Marvel continuity. He has been attempting to change, going on a medication, and Jan believes that joining the Ultimates could be a new start for them. But the tensions of losing and humiliating himself in a battle with the Hulk, and his jealousy of Jan's 'friendship' with Captain America, lead to a heated argument between the couple that ends after they have a violent fight, and Janet is hospitalized. Captain America himself takes revenge, beats him to a pulp despite the fact that Pym was giant-sized at the time, and forces him out of the team. |||| |||| He is eventually allowed back into the Triskelion, but not as a member of the Ultimates; instead, he serves with the staff and acts as a psychiatrist for inmates, including Norman Osborn, Otto Octavius, Maxwell Dillon, Flint Marko and Sergei Kravinoff. |||| |||| Henry seems to overcome his violent streak and becomes desperate to get in the Ultimates again, becoming the ant-manipulator 'Ant-Man' and building two prototype androids, Ultron and Vision II. Despite this, he remains a pariah, becoming increasingly depressed as S.H.I.E.L.D. debuted an entire team of Giant-Men who are capable of breaking the 60-foot 'limit' that he had been unable to overcome and making Hank's place obsolete. Desperate, he joins the vigilante team Defenders, starting a meaningless affair with Valkyrie and making a laughing stock of himself. |||| |||| In spite of his sad descent, he is able to relate to his estranged wife Jan again, and the two begin to see each other again (though their renewed relationship has been platonic so far). On a side note, he is visited by the traitor within the Ultimates — an object of great fan speculation, as of 2005 — but seems too much in a funk to seriously care (It is revealed in Ultimates 2 #9 that the traitor was Ultimate Black Widow). In recently published materials, it has been revealed that Pym is building an army of Ultrons for the invading Coalition. Hank Pym keeps the American populace in line using the Ultron robots he created, not knowing how full scale the attack will prove to be. |||| |||| As the tide of the battle starts to turn to the Ultimates favor, Hank orders the Ultron robots to help The Ultimates and they start taking out The Liberators armed guards. He swears to Quicksilver that he planned on infiltrating The Liberators from the start. Although he appears to be lying, at some point earlier he did give the Wasp a growth serum. Interestingly, when she uses it, she grows taller than Giant-Man ever did, to nearly the same size as the S.H.I.E.L.D. Giant-Men. Apparently Pym finally overcame the 60-foot limit that plagued him earlier in the series. |||| |||| As the Liberators are killed or arrested, Pym once again tries to convince the Ultimates he was on their side the entire time, but Captain America and even Thor don't want to hear it. As the series comes to a close, Jan visits him in the cell Thor and Hulk had occupied eariler, quipping 'So, do we all have spend a little time in these cells?' |||| |||| It has been suggested that this version of Hank suffers from bipolar disorder, which would explain his mood swings between manic/creative highs and depressive/violent lows. His use of Prozac seems to bear this out, as this drug is often prescribed to sufferers."

This often leads to Zatanna being gagged to prevent her from vocalizing a spell. However, even when she was shot in the throat by the Joker and unable to speak, she was able to write a healing spell with her own blood and cast it that way, proving that preventing her from speaking is not absolute proof against her magic.",None entered.

2480,Absorbing Man (Marvel),Carl 'Crusher' Creel ,2480_20051203101616_char.jpg,"* Berserker Strength |||| * Chemical Absorbtion |||| * Energy Absorption (with his ball and chain he took on the same power as for eg.Thor's Uru hammer as soon they came close) |||| * Immortal |||| * Invulnerability |||| * Matter Absorption |||| * Super Strength |||| * Unarmed Combat |||| |||| Creel has the power to absorb the physical properties of anything he touches. For example, if Creel were to touch and hold a piece of titanium steel, the tissues of his body would take on the appearance and properties of titanium. Creel also retains his intellect and capacity for speech regardless of the material he absorbs. The more dense, or durable, the material he absorbs, the stronger Creel is; were Creel to touch a high grade steel structure his strength would be roughly equal to that of the Thing. Creel also has the ability to absorb the same level of physical strength as the character he is touching. This power requires Creel's deliberate concentration, although he has a tendency to accidentally absorb materials he did not intend to. Creel's body can also absorb the properties of great amounts of energy in the same fashion it absorbs the properties of solid materials. Creel has proven able to absorb the mystical energies of Thor's enchanted Uru hammer on multiple occasions. |||| |||| The ball and chain that he carries is also mystically enchanted, and this power is extended to it. It is essentially an extension of his own body mass at this point. If the Absorbing Man's body is shattered, he has the ability to completely reconstitute his bodily mass without injury to himself, though it may take a great deal of time to do so. |||| |||| The greatest limitation of the Absorbing Man's powers is his intellect; the Absorbing Man is noticeably unintelligent. |||| |||| It was shown in a Hulk story that Creel developed the power of absorbing the minds of other people, and possessing their bodies. In that particular story, he was shown unusually smart and cunning. Whether this new power will be retconned or become a permanent addition is not certain yet.",,"Mainly an antagonist of Thor, The Absorbing Man was given an enchanted potion by the Norse god Loki which, once ingested, gave him the power to absorb the physical properties of anything he touched. Loki thought he was a perfect subject because he is brutal, savage, consumed with hatred for society. Thus, if he touched a steel wall, his whole body could become as hard as steel, while he could still move, think and speak; his strength also increased to the extent that he could battle such immensely strong heroes of the Marvel pantheon as Thor and the Hulk. If his body is damaged or shattered while in a non-organic form, he can reconstitute his body, although this takes a great deal of time and effort. |||| |||| He was in prison at the time of this power transfer, and the heavy ball and chain to which he was attached also magically gained the power. He therefore continued to carry the chain as a kind of mace. |||| |||| His main weaknesses are his low intelligence, making him relatively easy to outwit, and his power can be turned against him if he is tricked or forced into physical contact with a substance with an undesirably low strength. For instance, when fighting the Hulk once, he made the mistake of breaking glass above him, causing shards to fall on him. When he made contact with a shard, his body turned to glass and the Hulk instantly took advantage of this by punching and shattering his foe. |||| |||| Creel has absorbed the properties of a number of unusual or unique substances over the course of his criminal career, including adamantium, Captain America's shield, and Quasar's Quantum Bands. He also is known in the comics for transforming into water (One example is when he battled the Eric Masterson Thor in The Mighty Thor #436). |||| |||| Although Creel is a thug and a villain, he is not wholly heartless, and usually tries to avoid killing innocent bystanders (although he has no qualms about threatening or incapacitating them). In later years, he became romantically involved with fellow supervillain Titania (Mary 'Skeeter' McPherran) and the two were eventually married. |||| |||| The Absorbing Man is highly addicted to narcotics, especially pain killers and cocaine. When he is need of a high he has demonstrated no concern for the safety of others and will work for whatever criminal can supply him with narcotics. Recently, he was tricked into transforming into cocaine and minions operating powerful industrial fans scattered his body in the room he was occupying. His body mass was then collected off of the surfaces and placed into several bags. This all was the doing of The Owl who plans to sell this 'Creel cocaine', but after being used as a drug all over New York (all those who used the drug transformed into anything they came in contact with, just like Creel), Creel managed to reform himself but was defeated by Spider-Man and The Avengers."

Eons ago, the Eternians learned to control aging and eliminate natural death. To prevent overpopulation, the Eternian government sanctioned interstellar warfare and conquest which regularly claimed the lives of multitudes. When enemies could not be found to wage war against, the government held gladiatorial spectacles called The Games. Grom was a naturally skilled gladiator who earned in combat title Champion of Champions. Soon after Grom’s coronation, the Eternians discovered Gigantus, a huge planet on which dwelled an equally advanced but peaceful civilization. Immediately they launched an attack upon the world. Because Gigantus was several hundred times larger than Eternus (about the size of Jupiter), the war became very costly and difficult for the Eternians to sustain. Finally it was decided to simply obliterate the planet. The Eternians showered Gigantus with immensely powerful nuclear warheads and detonated them, destroying the planet. A huge armada of Gigantians, however, who had learned the ways of war after eons of peace, escaped the world’s destruction and attacked Eternus in retaliation. |||| |||| |||| Unprepared for so devastating an attack, the Eternian defenses fell. Government leaders realized that their race faced total extinction. Desperately Eternian scientists prepared to transform Grom, the race’s most outstanding physical specimen, into the receptacle of the collective consciousness and mental might of Eternus. As the surviving population of Eternus marched into huge “synthesizing chambers” scattered across the planet, their organic brains were converted to pure mental energy and projected into Grom. When the process was complete, and only the scientists who conducted the process were left alive, the capsule containing Grom was launched into space to incubate until the being learned to control the powers of his group mind. Eons passed. Then Grom emerged as the Overmind, a warrior who possessed the collective psionic power of the billion brains and who carried in his memory the subliminal command to subdue the universe. |||| |||| The Overmind attacked the first inhabited planet he came upon, the Earth, but was defeated by the Fantastic Four with the aid of the Stranger. The Stranger claimed to be the embodiment of the collective psionic power of all the surviving Gigantians. The Stranger’s psionic abilities proved to be more powerful than those of the Overmind and he shrunk the Overmind to microscopic stature and exiled him to a mote of dust. |||| Several years later, a demonic creature called Null the Living Darkness located Overmind and decided to use him as a pawn in his scheme of conquest. However, when he restored the Eternian to his original power and stature, Null accidentally transported the Overmind to an alternative Earth other than the one upon which he had met his defeat. This Earth was the home of the Squadron Supreme. Null and the Overmind battled the Squadron, who sent for reinforcements in the persons of the Defenders. A being composed of the psychic union of six of the alternate Earth’s most powerful telepaths also aided in the struggle, and were instrumental in neutralizing Null and the Overmind. At the battle’s end, the Overmind’s Eternian consciousness was driven out of its body and the six telepaths, lacking physical bodies, took refuge inside him. Now possessing a benevolent mind and a small fraction of his former mental might, the Overmind returned with the Defenders to their world. After parting company with the group, he set forth for parts unknown."

He was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix Lilandra from her insane brother, then-Majestor D'ken. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor. |||| |||| Later, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne from her sister, Lilandra, Electron was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as Excalibur and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named Rachel Summers. |||| |||| During the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires, Electron was one of a small contingent of Guardsmen that were dispatched by then-Empress Lilandra to retrieve both the famous Nega-Bands of the Kree warrior Captain Mar-vell as well as the powerful device known as the Omni-Wave-Projector. These devices were needed to create the Nega-Bomb - the weapon that ended the war by killing 90% of the Kree population. |||| |||| When the Empress Lilandra learned of the many Earth heroes that had sacrificed their lives to stop the malevolent psionic being named Onslaught, she dispatched eight members of the Imperial Guard, including Electron, to protect Earth. While on Earth, the Guard uncovered a plot by a militant Kree faction to simulate a radical political activist group in revenge for Earth's involvement in the Kree/Shi'ar war. In reality, the group created a 'nega-reactor', similar to the bomb that was used on the Kree. However, this plot was stopped by the Guard, but not before the reactor was used by the Kree's leader, the Supreme Intelligence, to re-incorporate itself after being presumably killed at the end of the war. ||||"

Seven extraterrestrial predators had come to Earth and slaughtered thousands of humans by feeding on their spinal fluids. On the run in New Orleans, Courtney was kidnapped by a cult that sacrificed her to two of these insatiable parasites, knows as Pritor and Lissik. But Courtney did not die. Instead, the parasites' bites unleashed the Animus, a sentient-energy creature that can absorb the spirit essences of the living and the dead, which was now able to enter the world through Courtney. She became the embodiment of mankind's rage and masculine drive, and quickly developed awesome physical powers of her own. As Anima, Courtney sought revenge against the cult. She also met the Teen Titans and battled a variety of supernatural menaces. Anima remains a wanderer, traveling from place to place and helping those in need by calling upon the fearsome primal force inside her. |||| |||| Anima featured prominently in DC Comics' Bloodbath limited series (1993), in which all the New Blood characters teamed up to help defeat the alien parasites who had empowered them. The following year she showed up in the Zero Hour crossover. |||| |||| Anima's own title, beginning December 1993, ran for 16 months before being canceled due to low sales (issues numbered 1-15, plus a #0 issue between #6 & #7 in line with Zero Hour). It was an unconventional DC comic book, with the main theme being a war between metaphysical beings who embodied the Jungian archetypes of human psychology - Animus was only one of these. The series had a huge supporting cast, both human and supernatural - in some issues, Anima herself appeared for only a few pages. Courtney's younger brother Jeremy Mason becomes the channel for Animus' evil sister, Eris (Eris shares her name with a goddess of Greek Mythology, who herself appeared in DC's Wonder Woman title, second series). Animus and Eris ultimately combine as the Syzygy, to fight their father/enemy known only as The Nameless One. The series featured innumerable pop-culture references, as symbols of the collective unconscious where the archetypal beings dwell. Fellow DC superheroes Superboy and Hawkman also guest-starred - with Superboy temporarily acting as a channel for an archetype called The Warrior. |||| |||| Since the demise of her title, Anima seems to have been virtually forgotten by DC and has appeared only once or twice, most recently in the final issue of Infinite Crisis. |||| |||| Later, Cyborg recruited Anima into a new team of Teen Titans."

Hercules' strength is well in excess of the 'Class 100' Level (able to lift/press in excess of 100 tons), making him, one of the strongest beings in the Marvel universe. Hercules has highly developed leg muscles, although they do not match those of the Hulk. Hercules can make a standing high jump of at least 100 feet in Earth's gravity. |||| Hercules is also an Olympian thereby being an immortal, and as true immortals, the Olympian gods do not age and are not susceptible to disease. Although they can be wounded in battle, they cannot die by any conventional means, and have a rapid healing rate. Hercules has a greater resistance to physical injury than any other Olympian god except for Zeus, and possibly Neptune and Pluto. Hercules is virtually tireless. His supernaturally enhanced musculature produces no fatigue poisons. He can even survive unprotected in the vacuum of space for a brief period of time. Only an injury of such magnititude that it incinerated him or dispersed a major portion of his bodily molecules could kill Hercules. In at least some such cases, Zeus or one of the other gods might still be able to resurrect him.",,"Hercules is the son of Zeus, king of the gods of Olympus, and Alcmena, a mortal woman who lived about three thousand years ago. Recognizing the need for a son who would be powerful enough to defend both the Olympian gods and humanity from future dangers he foresaw, Zeus seduced Alcmena in the guise of her husband, King Amphitryon of Troezen. Thanks to Zeus's enchantment, Hercules was born with the potential for extraordinary strength, which he first displayed before he was even one year old by strangling two serpents which attacked him. As an adult, Hercules is best known for his celebrated Twelve Labors, which were performed in part to prove his worthiness for immortality to Zeus. (One of these Labors, the cleansing of the Aegean Stables, was actually performed by the Eternal called the Forgotten One, who was sometimes mistaken for Hercules.) |||| |||| In the course of these Labors, Hercules provoked the wrath of three immortals who remain his enemies to this day. By slaughtering the man-eating Stymphalian Birds, he enraged the war god Ares, to whom they were sacred. In temporarily capturing Cerberus, the three-headed hound that serves as guardian to the Olympian underworld (not to be confused with the shape-shifting giant of the same name), Hercules offended Pluto, the lord of that realm. By killing the Nemean Lion, the Hydra, and other creatures spawned by the inconceivably grotesque and powerful monster Typhoeus, Hercules gained the bitter enmity of Typhon, the immortal humanoid offspring of Typhoeus and a Titaness. |||| |||| However, it was the centaur Nessus who caused Hercules's mortal demise. Nessus kidnapped Hercules's wife Deianeira, whereupon Hercules shot him with an arrow. Feigning a wish to make amends, the dying centaur told Deianeira how to make a love charm from his allegedly enchanted blood, aware that it was now tainted with the lethal poison of the Hydra, in which Hercules had dipped his arrows. Some time after Nessus's death, Deianeira, distraught over her husband's latest infidelity, rubbed the supposed love charm into Hercules's shirt. When Hercules's donned the shirt, the poison quickly worked and caused Hercules great pain. In an attempt to end this pain, he built a funeral pyre for himself and set it ablaze. Zeus intervened however, consuming the pyre with his thunderbolts and bringing Hercules to Olympus to be made a true immortal. |||| In an alternate future of the 23rd century, Hercules is the sole survivor of the Olympians, after Zeus had decided that the time had come for them to leave this plane of existence. Hercules then left Olympus to become the father to a new race of gods."

Kent was well known and followed around by the notable reporter Lois Lane who tracked his space farring exploits until he was lost on one of his space travels. He would later marry Lane who was revealed to be the super powered Amazon, Super-Woman. |||| |||| Kent was supposedly saved from a fiery death on his crashing space shuttle by benevolent aliens who reformed his body into the powerhouse that it now is. Later history states that Kent was kidnapped by an unspecified groups of aliens who had encountered Kent and decided to use the expendable Kent as a test animal for their weapons program. Kent was converted into a living power converter using Anti-Kryptonite as the base source. The aliens had succeeded in their plans of creating a living weapon, far exceeding their expected power levels. |||| |||| Unfortunately for the aliens, before Kent could be controlled after being powered, Kent mastered his emerging talents and killed his captors. The now superpowered Kent returned to Earth where he began his reign as superpowered Ultraman and began a life of conquerance of his home Earth. |||| |||| As Ultraman, Kent would inspire other powered beings to follow in his wake where they would form the Crime Syndicate and begin the process of ruling their planet. |||| |||| At some point, Ultraman came to encounter an Ultra-Dog called Neutro, which for some reason he put to sleep. |||| |||| It would be the result of Ultraman and his ruthless domination of their native dimension Earth that would cause that reality's Lex Luthor to rise up to protect his world from the repression of Ultraman and his associates in the Crime Syndicate of Amerika. Luthor's plan would result in the first cross Earth meeting where the Crime Syndicate would engage in battle against the Justice League before they were returned to the their Earth for fear of losing their home base to the social attitudes of those native to the Justice League's Earth. |||| |||| Luthor's plan initially failed to defeat the Crime Syndicate as his entire world basically accepts the Crime Syndicate as a legitimate entity. But Luthor succeeded in gathering new powered beings to oppose the Crime Syndicate. Most of these beings would reflect the criminal populace of the Justice League such as Sir Solomon Grundy and others. |||| |||| Arriving to Superman's Fortress through the Anti-Phantom Zone, Ultraman, alongside Owlman and Superwoman, were behind the Super-Baby under Superman's protection with the intention of killing him, but when the infant was finally in their possession they discovered it was no ordinary child. |||| |||| The baby revealed itself to be the antimatter Brainiac who became ultrapowerful by fusing with Ultraman's DNA. Planning to destroy both matter and antimatter worlds, Owlman used a bluff to scare Brainiac saying he had the means to destroy Ultraman and anyone with his power, greatly enraging the ultravillian. With Brainiac murdered by his wife, Ultraman and his allies returned to their world. |||| |||| JLA VS CSA |||| Ultraman's Crime Syndicate was once again the dominating force on their world with little to no opposition from anyone, suffering once again from boredom. Luckily for them, Power Ring found a place on their universe were they could find powerful beings to fight and kill, none other than Qward itself. Devastating the planet just for fun, the Syndicate battles until a mysterious event of sorts reshapes reality somehow, reversing time as well. Investigating the nature off the cataclysm, the Syndicate discovers that it was a matter-based wave, so they decide to invade the Earth of the League undercover, swapping their places with their matter counterparts and disguising like them. |||| |||| Trying to get information posing as Superman, Ultraman was having trouble as virtually no one was afraid of him, thus nobody had an inherent desire to obey him. That, plus the people's admiration over Superman caused Ultraman to finally lose it. Encountering and clashing against Superman, Ultraman nearly defeated the Kryptonian and joined his allies on their battle, easily overpowering the League and forcing them to flee, leaving the world for them to take. |||| |||| Deciding to stay, Ultraman and his Syndicate captured slaves in order to build a citadel, thus the League banded a group of reinforcements which successfully repelled the Syndicate and drove them to abandon Earth to look for the Justice League. Watching how the Qwardians destroy the League, the Syndicate was planning on letting them kill each other and take down the one left standing. But their fun was short as the Qwardians redirected their wrath against them and their world, forcing them to return there. Unable to defeat the Qwardians, the League was willing to help them if they asked them too, and besides Ultraman's objection, Superwoman asked them the favor, now owing them. After their victory over the Qwardians, Owlman sent the League back to their world and discovered that theirs was now full of chaos, with all their world rebelling against them. |||| |||| Some time after Qward's invasion, the Crime Syndicate begun a massive abduction of the several Earths' populace in order to gain slaves to rebuild their own wounded world. After the Justice League arrived to the antimatter Earth, the Syndicate arrived and confronted them with a hostage. Welcoming them, Ultraman told the League that they were willing to peacefully deal with them since they owe them a favor, but besides their newfound 'respect', they still went to the point of threatening the life of their hostage if they didn't comply to their demands, thus forcing Superman to accept the deal. |||| |||| Waiting for the League on their agreed meeting place, Ultraman and his Syndicate saw Superman arriving alone. When offering to release the people from their world to return the favor, Superman enraged to the offer of saving only their world and fought them all at once. Overwhelming Superman, the League arrived to support but they too were expected by the Syndicate who managed to turn the battle on their favor. However, Superman's gaining control over his senses gave him the skill he needed to overwhelm his foes and trap them on their own dimensional trap. Confined by Superwoman's Lasso, Ultraman revealed his enemies the true nature of their device before Superman activated it to banish him, Superwoman and Owlman to the interdimensiomal void. |||| |||| Ultraman and his allies were eventually set free and returned to their home Earth. |||| |||| Unknown to them, Alexander Luthor planted a matter-bomb on their world that would trigger in order to caught the Crime Syndicate off-guard with no way to defend themselves against it. Unable to stop the spreading destruction, the matter wave destroyed a quarter of their world before they could find a way to transport it to another world. |||| |||| Allowing the wave to consume that world, the Syndicate followed its last survivor, Green Lantern, to New Earth. |||| |||| Deciding to remain with a low profile, Ultraman suggested that they forget their own world and instead conquer this one, but Owlman was against it. Receiving news of the Justice League discovering their arrival, they left their low profile and went straight ahead against the League. Ultraman clashed against Supergirl until she was needed elsewhere and watched with indifference the display of power of the Omega Man. |||| |||| Witnessing the Omega Man's power, Ultraman apparently double-crossed the Syndicate and sided with him. Tired of his native Earth, Ultraman decided to help the Omega Man rule this Earth and destroy his old teammates. Watching his wife being beated by another amazon, Ultraman and the now evil Supergirl were waiting for the Omega Man's device to be completed so they could conquer the world, revealing that his' and the Syndicate's actions were a ruse to trick the League into helping them. However, turns out the League, too, was playing a ruse and tricked the Crime Syndicate to trap them and the Omega Man into the Multiverse."

In addition to his powerlance, the Black Knight carried a “paralyzer pistol” that fired a nerve gas. |||| |||| Paraphernalia |||| The Black Knight’s armor was a specially-designed steel-alloy chain mail that was bulletproof and electrically insulated. He also rode a flying steed that was mutated by his own genetic engineering.",,"A descendant of Sir Percy of Scandia, the original Black Knight from Medieval times, Nathan Garrett inherited Garrett Castle, the final resting place of Sir Percy. There, the spirit of Sir Percy appeared to him, charging him with becoming a modern-day crusader for good as a new Black Knight. However, Nathan proved unworthy and could not draw Sir Percy’s enchanted Ebony Blade. |||| |||| At some point, Nathan Garrett had become a Communist spy for the People’s Republic of China. He left his teaching position at Oxford University and became a U.S. citizen working for a research lab. He was also head of an espionage ring, selling American scientific secrets to China, until he was captured by Giant-Man (Henry Pym). He managed to flee to an undisclosed location in the Balkans where he decided to become the Black Knight, albeit one for criminal gain. With his new costume and weapons, he returned to America, but his first attempt at a robbery was thwarted by Giant-man, and he escaped again. |||| |||| The Black Knight was contacted by Baron Heinrich Zemo to help form the original Masters of Evil as a counterpart for the Avengers’ Giant-Man. However, Zemo’s plan, to defeat the Avengers and hold New York in thrall, failed, because the Avengers switched up opponents and the Black Knight was beaten by Thor. He escaped prison once to battle Iron Man, but he was defeated and remanded to custody again. Broken out of prison by the Enchantress and the Executioner, he joined another version of the Masters of Evil, but was again defeated by the Avengers. |||| |||| The Black Knight again tried to focus his efforts on defeating Iron Man by kidnapping Tony Stark’s friend Happy Hogan and holding him in a castle that was reconstructed in Washington D.C. The Knight actually succeeded in defeating Iron Man by disrupting the circuitry of his armor, and he flew with him into the sky, hoping to drop him from a great height. Instead, Iron Man managed to unhorse the Knight and they both fell. Iron Man’s armor recovered enough to fly him to safety, but the Black Knight was believed to have perished in the fall. |||| |||| On his deathbed, the Black Knight reached out to his only living relative, Dane Whitman, and revealed the truth about his secret identity. Full of regret, he charged his nephew with using his weapons and technology for good instead of evil. Nathan Garrett died, but Dane Whitman fulfilled his promise by becoming the heroic Black Knight. |||| Years later, Nathan Garrett was resurrected by Immortus as a part of his Legion of the Unliving. Immortus pitted the Legion against the Avengers as he hoped to enslave the Scarlet Witch and thus control time itself. The Black Knight was a merciless version of himself, but he was nonetheless defeated along with the others on his team. He was seen again as a member of another Legion of the Unliving, resurrected by the Grim Reaper into the body of a plane crash victim. The Legion, little more than violent, mindless zombies, battled the Avengers on behalf of the Reaper, who was seeking revenge on the Avengers for supposedly killing him. When confronted with the truth of his own suicide, the Reaper lost control over the souls of the Legion, which returned to the afterlife, and succumbed to the demon, Lliogoroth, who was feeding him power."

Firestorm can project bolts of nuclear energy, fly at great speeds, and absorb explosive force and radiation into his body harmlessly.","Firestorm has the ability to affect inorganic matter alone.  If he tries to affect organic matter, he causes a potentially harmful energy feedback.  Also, while intangible Firestorm cannot create energy bolts.","Nobel Prize winning physicist Martin Stein was the designer of the Hudson Nuclear Facility.  One of Stein's colleagues accused Stein of stealing the plans for the facility, thus causing the plant to not open on time.  That night, an anti-nuclear power group, including high school student Ronnie Raymond, plans to protest and sabotage the facility.  Unbeknownst to Ronnie, the leader of the group plans to sabotage the facility.  As Martin Stein attempts to activate the reactor, he is attacked and left unconscious.  Ronnie Raymond attempts to rescue Professor Stein, as the reactor goes critical, bombarding Stein and Raymond with radiation, causing them to fuse into Firestorm, the Nuclear Man. |||| |||| Initially, Stein had no memory of his time as Firestorm, and the lapses in memory drove Stein into alcohol abuse.  Guilt ridden, Ronnie ceased initiating the Firestorm transformation, until a crisis necessitated Firestorm's return.  Ronnie then came clean about Firestorm to Professor Stein, allowing Ronnie and Stein to act as a team. |||| |||| Eventually, Professor Stein was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor.  Convinced that Firestorm should go out with a bang, Stein convinced Ronnie to demand total nuclear disarmament. Caught at ground zero of a nuclear explosion with his Russian counterpart Pozhar, Firestorm found his matrix changed to Arkadin and Ronnie Raymond, though neither man controlled their new alter ego. Professor Stein (no longer part of the equation though heï¿½d unconsciously shaped the new Firestorm) was eventually located in a Nevada mental institution recovering from amnesia, but without free of hsi tumor. |||| |||| Later, this incarnation of Firestorm was nearly destroyed when a Russian clone of Firestorm absorbed his powers.  To prevent a threat, Raymond and Arkadin merged with the clone to create a new Firestorm, but they could no longer revert to their human counterparts. |||| |||| In the process, it was learned that Firestorm was originally meant to be Earth's Fire elemental, with Martin Stein as the sole host, however this had been corrupted when Ronnie attempted to save Stein.

However, Triumph inadvertently accepted an offer from Neron and sold his soul to regain the 10 lost years of his life.

336,Supergirl (DC)(Post Crisis)(03 - Kara Zor-El),Kara Zor-El ,336_20051120053858_char.jpg,Same as Superman of the post- Crisis Earth--but arguably stronger.,"She has a psychological aversion to long periods of time alone. |||| |||| Kara's aura does not protect her from magic-based attacks. She is vulnerable to mind control, as was the case with Saturn Queen and Dark Angel both manipulating her into making mistakes and destroying relationships with other heroes such as Power Girl and Powerboy. |||| |||| Kara is weaker or more prone to harm against magical creatures such as vampires & werewolf's. |||| |||| Being a Kryptonian, Kryptonite has harmful effects on Kara. Green-K will cause Kryptonite poisoning and ultimately death. |||| |||| Red Kryptonite has an unpredictable affect on Kryptonians. Examples of how Supergirl was affected by Red-K are as follows: changing into an adult Superwoman, splitting into two people, one half being Evil Kara, getting amnesia, and gaining the power to see through lead. However, the affects of exposure are only temporary, and if not fatal, will usually pass within one to 48 hours. |||| |||| Note that it was Kryptonite poisoning that caused all the bad girl behavior Kara displayed in the Superman/Batman comic, and in the first two years of Supergirl Vol. 5. Kryptonite poisoning caused her to not remember her childhood, allowing Darkseid to implant fake memories to create the Dark Kara persona. Thus all the memories of her killing students and murdering her mother was fake memories. Darkseid knew she would never kill her cousin willingly, so was trying to trick her into thinking she was saving the Earth from Phantom Zone phantoms if she killed Superman. However, she loved her cousin Superman too much to ever kill him for any reason. |||| |||| It was also Kryptonite poisoning combined with the fake kill Superman memories of Darkseid that was the secret reason for her violent behavior around other heroes. Examples include fighting the Teen Titans the first time they met; dislocating Superboy's jaw with a Super Punch; fighting the Outsiders; getting a tattoo; betraying the aliens in the bottled city of Kandor; not caring enough to even know her boyfriend's name; making out and then having a super fight with Powerboy; acting overly sexual and calling herself a crazy chick; All those out of character incidents and many more was caused by her Kryptonite poisoning; along with fake memories implanted by Darkseid; Lex Luthor using Kryptonite to bring out Dark Kara making the fake memories feel all the more real; Saturn Queen manipulating Supergirl's mind; Dark Angel manipulating Father Box, Powerboy, and Kara in an attempt to destroy her life. |||| |||| Besides her weakness to Green-K. Another kind is also very dangerous. But luckily Gold Kryptonite is rare. And fortunately so since it can rob a Kryptonian of their super-powers for 30 minutes, leaving them vulnerable to death by normal means. |||| |||| Blue Kryptonite has no effect on Supergirl, only on Bizarro imperfect duplicates. |||| |||| Kryptonians are able to harm each other more easily since they seem to be able to bypass each other's auras. |||| |||| Supergirl cannot see through lead. |||| |||| Supergirl would eventually weaken and become powerless without replenishing her energy reserves with normal (yellow) sun radiation. Also would lose her powers under a green sun. And retains powers in an orange-sun system and under a hotter blue-white sun her powers would be increased.","Numerical ordering of the name 'Supergirl' is highly problematic because of the many minor characters who have been known by that name, especially in the Golden and Silver Ages. For this reason, we will abandon the practice of 'numbering' Supergirls in favor of a more precise nomenclature. The Loeb/Turner 2004 relaunch of Supergirl was similar in many ways to the Loeb 2001 relaunch of Superman.  The recipe, it seemed, was to take a little something from each of the previous approaches to the character and blend it into a a simple, readily-coherent whole. While fans of the post- Crisis Supergirls may criticize Supergirl of New Earth for being a little TOO basic, the initial appearances of this version of the character have proven to be wildly popular among the comics-buying public. Like Supergirl of Earth 1, this Kara is definitely Kryptonian in origin, and, though there are characters in the DCU who have expressed doubt, appears to be definitely the cousin of Superman.   Medical scans have been shown to occur which appear to confirm this hypothesis. Other things that indicate her similarity to Superman are her fear of Kryptonite, the basic similarity of her power-set, and a mathematical extrapolation of her age given the known distance to Krypton and the speed of the craft. In an entirely Loeb-created twist, though, the journey of her craft was said to have kept her in some form of suspended animation, making her apparent age 'younger' than her actual age. She is in fact Superman's elder cousin, despite appearances and life experience. Though her identity as Superman's cousin seems all-but-absolutely-confirmed, her relationship with Superman has a bit more in common with Power Girl's relationship to Superman of Earth 2.  She visibly bristles at Kal-El's attempts to mentor her and has been shown to find more in common with Themyscira than the Fortress of Solitude. Indeed, this version of Supergirl has much more to do with Batman and Wonder Woman than any other version of the character, and the 'Big 3's' differing ideas on how best to help this Kara has been used to significant dramatic effect. Where Supergirl of the post- Crisis Earth was often depicted as a loner and Power Girl II has been a series of inconsistencies, Supergirl of New Earth has so far been able to act as a dramatically viable member of the larger DCU. So far, though, her lack of a secret identity has led all her interaction to be with other super heroes (or Amazons). Her initial appearance had certain commonalities with the Loeb-influenced portrayal of the character 'Kara' from the Season 3 finale of the TV program Smallville . Both that episode and issue #8 of Superman/Batman appear to have been produced around the same month in 2004, though it's an open question which was committed to paper first. Aside from the visual introduction (the first introduction to the comic Kara could be said to be an 'alternative' storyboard for the way the TV Kara was introduced), the main thing the comic and TV Karas share is initial amnesia. This is having profound implications for the development of the character because it introduces an element of doubt about her true origins, and it has set up the framework for a final post- Crisis definition of the only Supergirl variant still active in the DCU: Power Girl. Consequently, the origins of Power Girl as explored in JSA Classified have profound implications for this version of Supergirl. Indeed, Supergirl (2005) #1 was at least as much about Power Girl as it was about Supergirl of New Earth. As of this writing, it's unclear what that relationship is, precisely, but it is at least possible that an explanation might, in part, hearken back to concepts last explored in the later stages of Peter David's Supergirl run."

As such, he can elongate any part of his body, emit and control flames, use his control over flame to fly, become invisible, form invisible force fields, possess superhuman strength, and transform into a rocky hide/body armor. He is also capable of hypnosis. |||| |||| As a Skrull, Kl'rt is able to transform his body into any shape he wishes. Kl'rt is a trained soldier and commander in the Skrull army.",,"After the Fantastic Four stopped the Skrulls' attempted invasion of Earth, Skrull Emperor Dorrek invested vast resources into creating a superbeing of his own. K'lrt, a decorated soldier and warrior of the Skrull empire, was chosen to undergo a process that endowed him with all the powers of the Fantastic Four, except, when powered by an interstellar beam, far stronger. When the Super-Skrull first confronted the Fantastic Four, he bested them with their own abilities until Mister Fantastic identified the power source beamed from the Skrulls home planet and created a jamming device, depriving the Super-Skrull of his powers. Then the Invisible Girl tripped him into a crater and the Human Torch melted the rock around it to seal him in. |||| |||| Realizing their champion's predicament, the Skrulls developed a stronger source of power and beamed it to him. Re-powered, the Super-Skrull, disguised himself as Doctor Franklin Storm, the father of the Invisible Girl and the Human Torch, and again attacked the Fantastic Four. He called himself the Invincible Man, and claimed that he had received his powers in the Skrulls' prison laboratory. But Mr. Fantastic soon discovered the truth and threatened the Skrull homeworld with a fight to the death with the Super-Skrull and a direct atomic attack on their homeplanet. The Skrulls recalled the Super-Skrull and sent Dr. Storm back, although they first booby-trapped him with an explosive in an attempt to destroy the Fantastic Four. Storm, however, threw himself on the floor and took the brunt of the explosion to save his family and their friends, killing himself. |||| |||| His repeated defeats at the hands of the Fantastic Four allowed the Super-Skrull to fall out of favor with his government. Despite a second chance against the thunder Thor, the Super-Skrull was exiled. |||| |||| However, due to the loyalty to his race and his extreme power levels, the Skrulls have usually found they have need of the Super-Skrull, recalling him to service time and again. For example, Dorrek once hoped the Super-Skrull would the Kree Captain Marvel), disrupting the Kree from their surveillance of Earth, but Captain Marvel turned Kl'rt's power against him. Another time, he was drafted into the then-ongoing Kree-Skrull War, fighting the Avengers but hoping to take advantage of the war to increase his own political standing. This time, he was sent into permanent exile for treason. |||| |||| Working as a free agent, the Super-Skrull became an agent for Thanos the mad Titan, running once more into Captain Marvel. This time, his defeat left him stranded on Earth without interstellar transportation. Hoping to power a starship and flee the planet, he tried to steal the Cavourite crystal but was confronted by Ms. Marvel and Spider-Man. The Super-Skrull routed the two, but when he captured the crystal, its energies interfered with those of the interstellar beam that boosted his powers-- he found himself teleported to the Skrull throneworld. Unfortunately, he could never regain his physical form. |||| |||| The throneworld soon fell victim to Galactus, and the process of the planet's destruction send the Super-Skrull's disconnected form back to Earth, where it became trapped in the Van Allen Radiation Belts. Eventually, a group of scientists, including Dr. Walter Langkowski, a.k.a. the hero Sasquatch, made contact with the Super-Skrull's atoms with their equipment, inadvertantly allowing the Super-Skrull to reincorporate. The Super-Skrull's elation at being free was tempered with the fact that he was now physically dying. As a result of his entrapment within the radiation belts, he had developed a form of leukemia. Sasquatch battled the rampaging Skrull but was ultimately forced to return him to his discorporate state and return it to the Van Allen Radiation Belts once more. |||| |||| During his time of incapacitation, the Skrulls lost their natural shape-changing powers and their empire was decimated into factions. (In fact, K'lrt's wife R'Kll was the assassin who killed the Emperor Dorrek.) One of the self-proclaimed 'Empresses' of the empire's remnants, S'byll, tricked the Silver Surfer into using his power cosmic to re-form the Super-Skrull in order that they may aid her fleet in battle against the Badoon. This act threatened to escalate a new Kree-Skrull war, and the Super-Skrull convinced the Surfer to use his power cosmic to help him catalyze the latent shape-changing powers in S'byll's genetic structure. The two were able to awake the full power of a shape-changing Skrull in S'byll as well as to give her the ability to rekindle the shape-changing powers of others of her race. S'byll was sure that this ability would grant her support for her Empress-ship and allow the Skrulls to defy the Kree's genocidal efforts against the Skrulls. K'lrt stayed on as S'byll's champion, enjoying unparalleled fame as a great hero of the Skrull worlds. |||| |||| Shortly after, the enigmatic Stranger appeared and tried to add S'byll to his collection. The attempt was foiled when the pirate Captain Reptyl arrived on the scene and traded his entire pirate crew for her. In return for her freedom, he asked to become a privateer in her cause, and S'byll, happy to find a new ally, accepted his service. Enraged, K'lrt dueled with Captain Reptyl for the honor of being S'byll's consort and the Warlord of the Skrulls. K'lrt lost, and was believed slain, left to drift in space. In fact, the Super-Skrull did not die, but managed to find his way back to Earth where he decided to remain hidden until he could receive orders from a legitimate heir to Emperor Dorrek. |||| |||| At one point, the Super-Skrull duplicated the likeness of Danny Rand, a.k.a. Iron Fist, fully assuming his identity in order to use the Rand Corporation and gain economic control of the Antarctic paradise known as the Savage Land. This conflicted with the plans of another company, Oracle Inc., owned by Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner. Namor, Namorita, and Misty Knight confronted Super-Skrull, who, with his plans ruined, abandoned Rand's identity and fled. (The assembled heroes set out on a search for the real Danny Rand, eventually freeing him from the alien H'ylthri.) |||| |||| During his time of hiding, he appropriated the identity of Lon Zelig, a master of disguise, and he quickly gained renown in Hollywood. Eventually, he was targeted for assassination by other Skrulls, who believed K'lrt to be a living representative of an old regime and a dangerous potential menace. The Skrulls tricked the Human Torch into fighting alongside them, but K'lrt defeated the attempt and revealed the truth to the Human Torch before disappearing once more. |||| |||| The Super-Skrull was impressed into serving a Skrull faction led by the Intelligentsia, a Skrull version of the Kree's Supreme Intelligence. Although he apparently bristled at her leadership, he followed one of her orders to kidnap Kelly, a girl on Earth who held a special connection to the nexus of all realities. This first brought him into conflict with Captain Marvel over her fate, but Kl'rt kidnapped her, rather than killing her as was ordered, and returned to Intelligentsia with her. Hoping to stage a coup, with the girl's powers, the Super-Skrull again fought off Captain Marvel, but Kelly instead turned her power on herself, negating her abilities, rendering the whole thing moot. The Super-Skrull was never seen working with the Intelligentsia again. |||| |||| By this time, S'byll had died when her Skrull throneworld was destroyed by Devos. The Super-Skrull joined a faction of the empire who were seeking an heir to Emperor Dorrek, believing him to be found in Teddy Altman, Hulkling. Teddy was the product of the union between the original Captain Marvel and Princess Anelle, during the time of Marvel's abduction by the Super-Skrull many years ago. Despite the interference of Teddy's friends, the Young Avengers, the Super-Skrull revealed the truth of Teddy's origin and killed his 'mother', a Skrull sent by the Princess to raise her son on Earth. Teddy was forced to acknowledge his heritage to both the Kree and the Skrulls, dividing his time between the two empires. In fact, unknown to all but the Young Avengers, Kl'rt impersonated Hulking, taking his place and his role in order to spy on the two races. |||| |||| Shortly thereafter, however, the Skrull empire fell victim to the Annihilation Wave, although the Super-Skrull, for all his power, seemed helpless to stave its course. Believing his son to be residing on a planet in its path, Kl'rt and a Skrullian engineer R'kin hoped to find the secret to stop the Annihilation Wave and its weapon, the Harvester of Sorrows, from its source: the Negative Zone. Rallying troops from a penal colony within the Zone, the Super-Skrull was instead betrayed by R'kin, who held the Super-Skrull responsible for the death of his father. Imprisoned, Kl'rt used his hypnosis to force R'kin to free him and fellow prisoner Praxagora, the last of a robotic race. The Super-Skrull urged Praxagora to escape, but not before absorbing enough of her energy to make one final stand from within. Kl'rt sacrificed himself destroyed the Harvester, once more proving himself to be a hero for his people. Super-Skrull's body was later revealed to be in possession of Praxagora who had survived the explosion and joined the United Front against Annihilus. In one of the battles against Annihilus' forces Super-Skrull's body was reanimated by compination of Firelord's and Ravenous' powers as they unleashed them in the mist of the battle. He stayed with the United Front until the end of the war. |||| |||| Later, Ronan called both Kl'rt and Praxagora to Kree space in order to give them awards for their heroics during the war. However the Kree Empire was already infected by the Phalanx. Somehow the Phalanx had captured both Kl'rt and Praxagora and infected them with their techno-organic virus, causing them to become servants of the Phalanx. However, due to the intervention of the being known as Wraith both Kl'rt and Praxagora were freed from the Phalanx's control. |||| |||| Recently, Kl'rt made his way to Earth with the help of Nova during the Skrulls attempted take-over of Earth, Secret Invasion. After saving Nova from an army of Skrulls by pretending to have killed him, Kl'rt located his daughter, who was now living on Earth and working with She-Hulk as a freelance bounty hunter. Kl'rt had sworn that upon his next meeting with his daughter, he would kill her for being a traitor to their race. Unwilling to let Kl'rt kill Jazinda, She-Hulk battled Kl'rt, until Kl'rt was able to apprehend Jazinda. She-Hulk was able to piece together that Kl'rt was more upset that Jazinda had lived, while his son, who he considered his pride and joy, had died, and that is why Kl'rt despised Jazinda. In the end, Kl'rt did shoot Jazinda through the head, but did so knowing of the ability Jazinda has which renders her unable to die. Before she woke up, Kl'rt flew off, asking She-Hulk to tell Jazinda that he simply failed in his attempt to kill her, and to tell her anything other than he loved her."
254,Blue Devil,Daniel Cassidy ,254_20051219010959_char.jpg,"Even before he became Blue Devil, Dan Cassidy was a highly trained martial artist and acrobat. His costume included Kevlar body armor, visual and auditory amplifiers, radio gear, and servo-motors which increased his strength at least twenty-fold. After being grafted to Cassidy's body the costume became organic and gained the ability to self-repair at an extremely fast rate (effectively a healing factor). Cassidy's abilities seem to have been changed little by his transformation into an actual demon. |||| |||| Originally, Blue Devil wielded a trident of his own design which included, among other things, rocket engines capable of carrying two people at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour. He now carries the Trident of Lucifer, which allows him to find demons on Earth and banish them to Hell.","Standard Demon weaknesses, i.e. Holy Water, Hallowed Ground","Dan Cassidy was a special effects wizard and stuntman hired to create and play the title character in the movie Blue Devil. To that end Cassidy created a full-body costume with a hidden powered exoskeleton and built-in special-effects devices. When two of his co-stars accidentally freed a demon named Nebiros, Cassidy used his costume to drive the demon back, but not before being blasted with mystical energy. After the fight, Cassidy found that the blast had permanently grafted the Blue Devil costume to his body. |||| |||| Cassidy quickly found himself embroiled in repeated adventures and conflicts with supervillains. Apparently, the blast that fused him with his costume had also turned him into a sort of 'weirdness magnet'. Although he continued to seek a way to regain a normal life, Cassidy became more comfortable as a superhero over time and eventually joined the Justice League of America. |||| |||| When the demon Neron took control of Hell and began seeking souls on Earth, Blue Devil was one of those he approached. Neron offered him a chance to be a movie star, but neglected to mention that the bargain would also result in the death of one of Cassidy's closest friends. In the end, Cassidy cheated Neron of his prize but died in the process. Cassidy was soon reincarnated as an actual demon. Now, instead of a man in a costume, he was an actual Blue Devil. |||| |||| Cassidy rejoined the Justice League and remained with them until his second death, this time at the hands of the villainous Mist. His bones were secretly recovered by the magician Faust, who eventually restored Blue Devil to have him destroy Nebiros. Cassidy then joined the Sentinels of Magic and eventually gave his life a third time fighting Hermes Trismegistus. He did not remain dead long, however, and roamed the Earth for a time banishing demons back to Hell."

The Manhunters were the first attempt of the Guardians of the Universe to create an interstellar police force that would combat evil all over the cosmos. Their name and much of their code of behavior was modeled by the Guardians of the Universe on the Manhunters of Ma'aleca'andra (Mars) millions of years ago (This creates an apparent chronology problem, since the Manhunters were created many millions of years ago, while the Green Martian race came into existence from the Burning Martians only about 20,000 years ago). For thousands of years, they served the Guardians well. However, the Manhunters became obsessed with the act of 'hunting' criminals. Their code, 'No man escapes the Manhunters' (corrupted from the original), became more important to them than seeing justice done |||| |||| Eventually, the robots conspired to rebel against their masters, but the Guardians defeated and destroyed most of them. Those that survived hid away on many planets, slowly rebuilding their forces and spreading their beliefs to others. Since then, the over-riding goal of the Manhunters has been to take revenge on the Guardians, as well as on their replacements, the Green Lantern Corps. The Manhunters infiltrated and liberated many planets disguised as living beings and created a 'Cult of the Manhunters' that trained others to be their minions. On Mars, the people of that world started a group of Martian Manhunters based on the lessons of preserving justice taught unto them by the Manhunters and even erected a temple based on the appearance of their inspiration. On Earth, most of the Manhunters' agents were unaware that their masters were robots, or that their real purposes were not noble. Some of these agents became superheroes also known as Manhunters. They wore red-and-blue costumes patterned after the Manhunters themselves. |||| |||| The Manhunters were discovered by the Justice League who seemingly defeated the Manhunter's leader, the Grandmaster. One of their human pawns, Mark Shaw, adopted a new identity as the costumed hero, the Privateer. However, he was later discovered to be a criminal posing as a hero. |||| |||| Years later, it was revealed that the Manhunters not only still existed, but had infiltrated the lives of most superheroes with their agents. They even managed to infiltrate the Olympian Gods, one of their number posing as the goat god Pan, as shown during the Challenge of the Gods storyline. They revealed themselves when a Guardian and a member of the Zamarons tried to evolve some humans into becoming the next Guardians of the Universe, during what became known as the Millennium crisis. On this occasion, there was a massive counter strike operation by the heroes against the Manhunters, and it seemed that the Grandmaster had finally been destroyed, along with their hidden home planet. Former Privateer Mark Shaw readopted his identity as Manhunter in the wake of the battle, seeking to redeem both the name and himself |||| |||| Kyle Rayner encountered the Manhunters not long after Hal Jordan's destruction of the Guardians and the Central Power Battery on Oa. The first of which encountered a still inexperienced Kyle Rayner and was almost able to defeat him using brute force until Kyle used his wits to outsmart and decapitate it. The next time, multiple Manhunters appeared. They were all sentient, individuals, and captured Kyle in an attempt to use his last remaining Green Lantern ring for their purposes. They failed and Kyle managed to escape. |||| |||| When the Manhunters were replaced by the Green Lantern Corps, they retreated to Biot, their homeworld in Sector 3601, an uncharted area of space incapable of sustaining organic life. Hank Henshaw, the Cyborg Superman, came to Biot and became the Manhunters' new Grandmaster. He used his mastery over machinery and Kryptonian technology to upgrade the Manhunters with organic enhancements. They seem to have rebuilt the first Central Power Battery originally destroyed by Hal Jordan (under the influence of Parallax). Henshaw decided not to interfere in the reformation of the Green Lantern Corps after an encounter between a Manhunter and Green Lanterns Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner |||| |||| The Manhunters resurfaced as part of the Sinestro Corps. They carried miniature yellow Power Batteries inside them which were used by the Sinestro Corps members to charge their yellow power rings. |||| |||| In a revision of Hal Jordan's beginnings, it was revealed that the Manhunters suffered a programming glitch that caused them to wipe out all life in space sector 666, believing it to be evil. It was eventually revealed that the programming glitch the Manhunters suffered was caused by Krona to prove to the other Guardians of the Universe that there are flaws in an emotionless police force. |||| ||||"
5006,N'Astirh,,5006_20060421231258_char.jpg,"Vast magical powers grants him the power to generate mystical energy as force bolts and protective shields, increase his size and strength, regenerate his injuries and tap into the innate evil of humans and turn them into demons with a touch. Flight due to natural leather wings. Techno-organic virus mutatation allows him to rebuild his body from a single cell when destroyed or injured, can infect others with techno-organic virus. Virus also granted him a computer like mind allowing him to cast spells and process them almost simultaneously.",,"N'Astirh was a demon with great magical skills and a master manipulator. Despite his power and loyalty to his lord Belasco he rebelled when Belasco chose a human, Illyana Rasputin as his apprentice. N'Astirh formed an alliance with S'ym, the strongest of Belasco's demons. When Illyana rose against Belasco, N'Astirh stole Belasco's spellbook and fled from Limbo into Earth's past. When Illyana left Limbo, S'ym summoned N'Astirh again and they plotted against her. Due to the Magus invasion of Limbo, S'ym was turned into a techno-organic being. As a techno-organic being, S'ym became more powerful and took over Limbo. |||| |||| N'Astirh made pacts with various villains in the Marvel Universe, such as Cameron Hodge, Hobgoblin (Macendale), and Madelyne Pryor. The latter used this alliance to get revenge against her creator Mister Sinister and her ex-husband Cyclops. N'astirh had previously led Madelyne to Sinister's genetic lab, to rescue her baby, and to confront Mr. Sinister. Madelyne then learned that she was merely a clone of Jean Grey, whom her husband had actually loved, and left her upon learning that she was still alive. With the help of N'astirh and his fellow demon S'ym, Madelyne's psionic powers (far stronger than her progenitor's) were triggered, transforming her into the Goblin Queen. When he realized that Madelyne could not be used as his pawn openly he devised another way of coercing her to the dark side. When she was bound and defeated by Sinister he left her to fend for herself while he infected himself with the transmode virus. The virus changes his coloring from green to red. He also claims he has 'become' magic, since he can now process and cast spells almost simultaneously. |||| |||| When N'astirh knew she had fallen into madness he returns and presents Madylyne her son as chief sacrifice. |||| |||| Madelyne Pryor, N'astirh and S'ym then plotted a demonic invasion, starting with Manhattan, known as the Inferno Crisis. During the invasion N'astirh also coerced Illyana Rasputin and Meggan towards their darker sides--Magik having a tie to the demonic realm Limbo (transforming her into Darkchylde) and Meggan being an empathic shapeshifter who was swayed by the dark emotions around her (transforming her into the Goblin Princess). N'astirh was also known for his twisted sense of humor. When Jason Phillip Macendale, then the Hobgoblin, offered to make a Faustian bargain to trade his soul for the power of a demon, N'astirh laughed and scoffed at the offer, thinking Macendale's soul to be too pitiful to be of any worth. In return for amusing him, however, N'astirh granted Macendale's request by fusing the hapless human with a demon, which would eventually break away to become the Demogoblin. |||| |||| However N'astirh's invasion attempt was thwarted by the X-Factor, New Mutants, the X-Terminators and the X-Men. He was frozen and shattered and ultimately destroyed by an overload of lightning driven into him by Storm. |||| |||| Recently N'astirh has reappeared at the side of Illyana Rasputin, during the recent 'Quest for Magik' storyline. Whether or not this is the original N'Astirh or like Illyana a possible alternate reality version is unclear. This version appears to be more savage and primitive in nature and has not yet displayed any of the powers of the original. He also does not appear to be a techno-organic being"

Relationship distinguished from Clark's with Lois, because Lana fell in love with Clark long before there was a Superman.

261,Copperhead (DC)(01 - Unknown),,261_20070217061424_char.jpg,"The original Copperhead's contortionist skills allow him to fit himself into incredibly small spaces (such as chimneys). He originally wore a snake-themed costume. The suit was a weave of metallic and elastic fibers coated in vulnerable points (such as the chest) with Kevlar, making it bulletproof and impenetrable to almost any cutting edged weapon. The costume had been treated with a highly slippery water- and heat-proof silicon gel, allowing Copperhead to slide along any surface and slip out of tight spots. The tail could be stretched several feet and was strong enough to snap bone and shatter stone. The suit's helmet contained two seven-inch-long fangs which were capable of piercing human skin, and were coated in a potent neuro-toxin derived from copperhead snakes. The toxin could paralyze a person almost instantly, and death would follow within 30 minutes. |||| Later, the original Copperhead sold his soul to the demon Neron and was transformed into a human-snake hybrid. His reflexes and agility were greatly increased, and he gained venomous fangs, a forked tongue, claws, and a prehensile tail.",,"The criminal known as Copperhead first appeared in Gotham City in a snake costume. He committed numerous thefts before finally being apprehended by Batman and the first Batgirl. Copperhead then turned to more deadly pursuits as a super-assassin, constricting victims to a suffocating death with his costume's tail. During this time, he would become obsessive about his target and think of nothing until the target was dead, which proved to be a weakness at times as he would ignore anything he did not consider immediately relevant. |||| Copperhead used the travel opportunities his freelance career afforded him to pursue his hobby of collecting transistor radios. |||| Although a master contortionist, Copperhead was largely powerless without his snakeskin costume. He later sold his soul to the demon Neron in exchange for more power, being transformed into a deadly Snake/Man hybrid. He was later killed by Manhunter, Kate Spencer."
153,Lockjaw (Marvel),,153_20070225060724_char.jpg,"Lockjaw is able to teleport himself and a group of people up to a extensive distance, even from the Earth to the Moon. He also has an increased sense of smell and a strength in his jaw which may be due to his immense size.",,"Lockjaw is a member of the Inhumans royal family, mutated by the Terrigen Mists into his canine form. He followed along behind the Inhuman Crystal when she wandered from her family’s hidden base while they searched for their queen, Medusa. When Crystal met the Human Torch and confused him for an Inhuman, Lockjaw opened the hidden door to their base to let them both in and then teleported away. |||| |||| |||| When the rest of the Inhumans, led by Black Bolt, fought the Fantastic Four, Lockjaw appeared as his leader’s command and trapped the Thing with a steel girder. Even though the Thing bent the girder, he was unable to pry it from Lockjaw’s mouth until the Human Torch flew by and melted it. But Crystal appeared shortly afterwards and announced Triton’s capture by the Seeker, and so Lockjaw teleported the Inhumans back to Attilan while Johnny Storm and Crystal tried to stay together but were torn apart. |||| |||| |||| Lockjaw was in Attilan when Black Bolt took his crown back from his brother, Maximus, and reclaimed his leadership of the Inhumans. Later, Maximus tried to kill all of humanity with his atmo-gun, which failed because both Inhumans and humans were of the same race. And Lockjaw was seemingly trapped within Attilan, along with the rest of the Inhumans, when Maximus reversed his machine’s energies in a rage, creating a Negative Zone around the city. But his powers of teleportation allowed him to roam free, and he left the city, wandering the countryside and inadvertently terrorizing the populace; eventually running into the Human Torch and Wyatt Wingfoot. The pair tried to train him while he took them on a teleporting trip around the planet, and presumably off it, before sensing danger and returning them to New York in time to join the fight against Doctor Doom; who had stolen the power cosmic from the Silver Surfer. |||| |||| |||| When Maximus briefly regained the Inhuman throne, he used his hypnotic science to control Lockjaw and force him to teleport to the Baxter Building and kidnap the newest member of the Fantastic Four: Crystal. But Black Bolt soon freed his people and sent Maximus scurrying to a hidden rocket, freeing Lockjaw."
2974,Abomination (Marvel),Emil Blonsky ,2974_20051218184831_char.jpg,"Blonsky's transformation into the Abomination substantially increased his bone/muscle mass and height (he stands 6 feet, 8 inches tall). The resultant levels of superhuman strength, endurance and durability surpass those of the Hulk when the Hulk is not angered; the upward limit of what the Abomination can press is over 150 tons and as high as 200 tons but not incalculably high. However, unlike the Hulk in most of his incarnations, the Abomination's strength does not increase as he becomes angry (the Abomination's strength does not nearly approach that of the enraged Hulk). Like the Hulk, the Abomination can use his superhumanly strong leg muscles to leap great distances, covering up to two miles in a single bound. |||| |||| Unlike the Hulk, the Abomination's transformation has proved stable: he cannot change back and forth between his human state and his superhuman state, despite his wishes to the contrary. Though the Abomination has proven able to regenerate lost eyes and recover from other forms of massive cellular damage, his ability to regenerate tissue is much slower than that of the Hulk. The Abomination is resistant to extremes of temperature, and can hold his breath for extended periods of time; in the case of lack of air or heat, he may enter a coma-like state of suspended animation.",,"Formerly known as Emil Blonsky, a spy of Soviet Yugoslavian origin working for the KGB, the Abomination gained his powers after receiving a dose of gamma radiation similar to that which transformed Bruce Banner into The Incredible Hulk. As a result he was permanently transformed into a massive green-skinned monster whose physical power was equivalent to, if not greater than, that of the Hulk. While he was able to maintain his normal level of self-control and intelligence after this transformation, he is unable to return to human form. |||| |||| Given his gamma-spawned origins, Blonsky blames his condition on Banner and his alter ego, the Hulk. Both the Abomination and the Hulk have clashed on numerous occasions, with Blonsky perpetually playing the role of the aggressor. Although Blonsky occasionally gains the upper hand in their battles, the Hulk manages to triumph in the end. But not always; the Abomination is one of the few who can lay claim to victory over the green-skinned goliath. |||| |||| In recent years, it was revealed that his hideous new visage had served to alienate Blonsky from his ex-wife, Nadia. Coupled with constant defeats at the hands of the Hulk, this has driven Blonsky nearly insane in his hatred for Banner. The Abomination also grew incensed upon learning that Banner had married Betty Ross, the daughter of General Thunderbolt Ross. With the loss of his wife, Blonsky figured it is only fair to him that Banner should lose Betty. Out of jealousy, he caused the apparent death of Bruce Banner's wife Betty. While she was recovering from radiation sickness caused by exposure to the gamma radiation within Banner, he poisoned her with his radioactive blood, causing Banner and his associates to believe that her close proximity to the Hulk had given her a fatal case of radiation poisoning. Banner later exposed the Abomination's role in Betty's seeming death, and defeated him in combat. |||| |||| Not only his grand scheme failed, Banner also forgave Blonsky. The Abomination could not comprehend and endure his enemy's absolution, and his moment of triumph was twisted into crushing defeat. Blonsky realized he had become what he abhored the most - he was the rampaging, inhuman monster, not the Hulk he religiously believed all these years. |||| |||| Months later, the still-grieving General Ross manipulated the Hulk into attacking and almost killing Blonsky. The Abomination was taken into custody by the military; as punishment, he was forced to watch a film loop of himself and his wife prior to his transformation, making his incarceration a constant reminder of what he has lost."
