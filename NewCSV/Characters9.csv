640,Spider-Woman (Marvel)(02 - Julia Carpenter),Julia Cornwall Carpenter ,640_20051028170528_char.jpg,"As Spider-Woman, Julia had enhanced strength, speed, stamina, agility and reflexes. She could generate and manipulate strands of psionic force, which she often wove into adhesive 'psi-webs' to snare her targets. By concentrating this psionic force in her hands and feet, she could cling to and crawl across any surface, even scaling sheer walls. Whether any of her lost powers will regenerate remains to be seen.",,"An athletic young single mother, Julia Carpenter was drawn into a covert double life by an old college friend, federal agent Valerie Cooper, who believed Julia would be an ideal test subject for a secret government super-agent program. Reuniting with Carpenter seemingly by chance, Cooper promised her cash-strapped friend lucrative employment and manipulated Julia into undergoing a series of experimental treatments, including injections of a formula incorporating rare Amazon jungle plants and spider venoms, which gave Julia superhuman powers. She became an operative of the Commission on Superhuman Activities (CSA) as Spider-Woman. The CSA was based in Washington, but Julia initially moonlighted as a seemingly independent super hero in Denver. When the near-omnipotent Beyonder abducted an entire Denver suburb (including the Carpenter home) into space as part of his Secret Wars, Julia fought the Beyonder's army of villains alongside the heroes the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, the Hulk and Spider-Man (who was so impressed by Julia that he 'thought up' her costume design for his new one when his was damaged). |||| |||| Arrogant, greedy and self-absorbed, Julia's ex-husband Larry had lost custody of their daughter Rachel after Julia divorced him for cheating on her; but when Julia's secret Spider-Woman career led to frequent unexplained absences on her part, Larry sued for custody of Rachel and won. Meanwhile, Julia served reluctantly with the ruthless CSA-sponsored super-team Freedom Force until they arrested the Avengers on false treason charges. A sympathetic Julia freed them and became a fugitive herself, though the Avengers were soon exonerated. Cooper later gave Carpenter a second chance, employing her as a solo operative supervised by unscrupulous CSA agent Mike Clemson; but after aiding the Avengers against the Pacific Overlords, Julia joined the Avengers and cut ties with the CSA. While serving with the western Avengers roster, Julia fought the criminal trio Deathweb; their powers, like hers, came from the formula of the CSA's Dr. Carter Napier. Deathweb and their employer, the Manipulator, fought Julia several times, killing Larry and Napier, threatening Rachel and menacing Julia's parents, the Cornwalls, who as Amazon jungle guides had helped locate the ingredients for Napier's formula; but Julia ultimately defeated the villains, saving her daughter and parents. |||| |||| When the Avengers decided to close their west coast base, Julia resigned in protest and joined several other ex-western Avengers in founding the new Force Works super-team, though it soon disbanded and Julia renewed her ties with the Avengers on an inactive basis. She was later forced to retire from superheroics after a crippling attack by a rival criminal Spider-Woman, Charlotte Witter, who drained away Carpenter's superhuman powers. Aided by the young new Spider-Woman, Mattie Franklin, Witter lost possession of the stolen powers. |||| |||| Shortly after the Superhuman Registration act was passed, Julia was persuaded by Tony Stark (Iron Man) to join his team. Alongside with Ms.Marvel and Wonder Man, her mission was to train other registered super heroes to perform government-authorized security activities. As well as the standard apprehension of unregistered super heroes. |||| |||| She was soon sent to go after The Shroud (Max Coleridge), an unregistered super hero and Julia's new boyfriend. To her change of heart, Julia helped him escape Ms. Marvel and Wonder Man. She's currently a fugitive."

940,Ragman (DC)(Post Crisis)(01 - Rory Regan),Rory Regan ,940_20070222200901_char.jpg,"Ragman Suit: The Great Collector Artifact, a mystical Jewish artifact created to protect the Jewish communities ever since the time of Abraham. |||| |||| Telekinetic Suit Control: Also, the Ragman possesses a number of minor magical powers, such as kinetically controlling the suit (i.e. entangling Eclipso with his cloak while grappling with her) |||| |||| Multitude of Forms: It has recently been revealed that the suit can take on other forms, such as weapons, and still collect souls. Whether Rory will use this ability in the future is yet to be seen. |||| |||| Precognitive Dreams: Rory had occasional precognitive dreams, though they were too vague to provide useful information |||| |||| Superhuman Durability: Regan is the latest Ragman, an avenger and protector empowered by a mystical suit. While the wearer is bonded to the Ragman costume, he is almost impossible to destroy. While his durability is only slightly superhuman, any damage sustained is repaired in seconds. |||| |||| Superhuman Agility: It gives the users prodigious leaping ability |||| |||| Levitation: can slowly float through the air |||| |||| Discorporate: discorporate and reform great distances away. The latter form of discorporation can also be used in a more limited manner to avoid physical attacks by allowing the rags to simply flow around objects as well as to ensnare nearby opponents by smothering them in a cloud of rags. |||| |||| Sense Evil Souls: Perhaps the most macabre of the costume's abilities is the stealing of souls. The suit is drawn toward evil souls; it can sense them in its vicinity and is compelled to seek them out and attack them. This compulsion is also inflicted upon the wearer if he has the costume on. The evil acts of people who have been detected in this manner can also be sensed by the Ragman. This sensing of sins does not work on those people or beings who are not evil. |||| |||| Steal Soul: The suit can steal a person's soul as long as it is still touching his body. Ragman will usually subdue a target (knock them unconscious or Stun them) to minimize their ability to resist, but this is not necessary. Once a soul is absorbed, the body is left a brain-dead husk and the mind and spirit become yet another rag on the costume. The stolen soul is not affected if the physical body subsequently dies. |||| |||| The costume can steal souls that are not evil. Indeed, on two occasions the ability to absorb the souls of good people was essential for keeping the suit under control. On another occasion, Rory attempted to use the suit to absorb the amoral soul of a mystic servitor. He was able to begin the process but the servitor fought it off, indicating that the suit has difficulty absorbing the souls of mystically-powerful creatures. |||| |||| Boost Physical Attributes: After a soul is incorporated into the Ragman suit, it can be used in several ways. Its energy can be directed into boosting the wearer's strength, speed, coordination, and fighting prowess. When the wearer uses it in this manner, he can become such a skilled combatant that he can easily defeat a roomful of armed men without being struck in return a single time in the process. |||| |||| Boost Influence: This energy can also be directed into making the Ragman's influence more formidable -- when concentrating on such actions, the mere presence of the Ragman can make groups of armed gunmen stop attacking or even flee the scene. |||| |||| Absorbed Memory Recall: The wearer can also look into the memories of the absorbed soul and extract any information therein as desired. It is also possible that the wearer might be able to use some of the abilities possessed by the souls in the rag suit -- using a captured sorcerer's memories to cast spells, for example -- but this is only speculation. |||| |||| Soul Redemption: There is an implied redemption of evil souls contained within the rag suit, but no mechanism for this has yet been shown. Rory's comments seem to indicate that this redemption is linked to the soul willingly assisting the wearer in his mission and thus slowly working off its moral debt. This process has been stated to take a century or more. While the souls power the suit, no single soul seems to make a noticeable difference in the Ragman's power levels. Accordingly, the acquisition or loss of souls as time goes by is usually not a serious concern to the current trustee of the costume. |||| |||| Telepathic Bond: Like all of those who have trained in the use of the suit, Rory has formed a rudimentary telepathic bond with the Ragman costume. He can communicate with the suit's collective personality -- though he speaks out loud, only he can hear the suit's replies. Rory also uses this trait to summon the suit to him over short distances. |||| |||| Sense Disposition: Though detailed exchanges are only possible at short range, those attuned to the suit in this manner can still get a general sense of its disposition while active, and vice versa. For example, the Rabbi who trained Gerry sensed when the suit became active again (when Rory first put it on) and where it was despite being an unknown distance away. The suit also sensed when the Rabbi passed away and relayed that information to Rory even though the Rabbi was no longer in the same city as Rory and the suit when he died. Rory has not as yet developed this second talent -- it may require additional special training in Jewish mystic rituals such as the Rabbi had. |||| |||| Inspire Hope: Because the Ragman was created as a symbol of hope to protect communities, he can over time form a limited psychic bond with the people of a given neighborhood. When this process is complete, the people of the community will find themselves acting as one with the Ragman to confront local threats. Once this occurs, the Ragman's work is finished and he will move on, teleporting to a new place that needs his help. How the suit determines where the Ragman is needed next is unknown. The suit has an additional failsafe that compels the wearer to teleport away if the battle for a neighborhood is hopeless. The Ragman was meant to inspire hope, so staying to fight a lost cause would be futile; the suit's creators felt it was better to have the Ragman live to fight another day rather than be destroyed.","Fire Vulnerability: However, the rags are extremely vulnerable to fire, a weakness added by the Rabbis who created the Ragman as a security measure in case the suit fell into the wrong hands. |||| |||| Pain of Soul Taking: However, Rory has mentioned that the process of acquiring a new soul gives him stomach cramps and nausea.","A community of Jews in 16th century Eastern Europe created the Ragman to replace the Golem, their previous defender. Gerry Regan was the last European Ragman, as he, still named Jerzy Reganiewicz, fled to the United States after failing to protect the Jewish population from Nazi persecution. After settling down in Gotham City, Regan passed the mantle of Ragman to his son Rory. Rory Regan is a ragman, doing good in his community by buying used items from people who need money. The suit of rags that he wears was originally just a costume made from materials found around the rag shop he shared with his father, Rags'n'Tatters. Currently each of the patches in the suit is made from the soul of an evildoer that the Ragman had punished and absorbed. The absorption of these souls caused a problem for Rory at one point, when the evil souls hungered for murder and finally freed themselves of Ragman. It was only with the support of Batman and Regan's old friend, Rabbi Luria, that he regained control, though at the cost of Luria's life. Ragman's powers have increased since then. Currently, he can absorb souls into his costume. With each new soul added, a rag is added. He can call upon the souls in his costume to lend him their attributes or power. He is also a very proficient magic user. |||| Judgment and Vengeance |||| |||| Ragman was active in destroying many of the demons invading Earth. This would earn him the wrath of the Diablos, a group of demons who style themselves after the Mafia. Wanting to gain revenge for demons lost during the Day of Judgment, they attack Ragman, injuring him and tearing off parts of his costume. They believe him to be dead but this is not true. |||| |||| Ragman is one of the members of the Shadowpact, a team that formed to confront the Spectre. |||| |||| During 'Infinite Crisis', Ragman and Nightshade are seen standing side by side as part of the line of superheroes defending Metropolis from attack from dozens of villains. |||| |||| Ragman is one of the few volunteers willing to take on the rampaging Spectre, who has decided that all magic is evil. During a planning sessions, he is taken aside by the Enchantress and given a mystical gun. She entrusts him with it, as it can kill her if she goes too far with her magic, a scenario she believes is all too possible. He tells her if she truly turns evil, his costume will take her. He then tries to kiss her, but his feelings are not returned and Enchantress even mocks him for it in front of the other heroes. |||| Shadowpact |||| |||| Ragman, along with his teammates, was trapped inside a shield of solid blood that grew over the town of Riverrock, Wyoming. Ragman and the rest of the team spend a very short period of time inside the shield, but to due to magical after-effects, a full year passes outside. Various mystical heroes, such as Phantom Stranger and Rex the Wonder Dog keep watch outside the town's borders. |||| |||| While inside Riverrock, Rory met an evil counterpart of himself belonging to the supervillain group that had formed the shield, the Pentacle. His counterpart is named Bagman. He/it dresses in similar green garb, and can turn his body to goo and while in this form he absorbs people. While inside Bagman they either suffocate or they are digested. Bagman even mentioned how oddly similar the Shadowpact and the Pentacle are. Rory only survives this encounter because Bagman's boss does not want the heroes to be killed. After the Riverock encounter, Rory must deal with the severe disruption to his life, as everyone had thought he was dead. He, like most of the team, ends up having to find a new source of income, a place to stay and the oddity of encountering a memorial statue to the entire team. |||| Rory was temporarily trapped in the limbo dimension of his own cloak. He met the soul of an ancient Centurion working off his crimes. This man, Marcus Liberius, first saved him from the beating several other of the murderous souls were giving Rory. Marcus reveals that the cloak was actually the 'Great Collector Artifact', which has been in existence in many forms since the time of Abraham. Ragmen in Rory's line have been in action since 1812 BCE. Marcus also helped Rory, who had become disenchanted with the job of collecting corrupted souls, to see that he is not a punisher but a redeemer — allowing a better afterlife for those who work for it. This work usually takes the form of suffering on Rory's behalf. For example, Rory had been recently blinded by magic. Marcus willingly takes this blindNess on, adding to previous injuries he had suffered. This last sacrifice allows Marcus, in the full view of the rest of the Shadowpact, to ascend to a higher realm."

2936,Captain Marvel (Marvel)(01 - Mar-Vell),Mar-Vell ,2936_20060707193545_char.jpg,"* Agility |||| * Blast Power |||| * Cosmic Awareness |||| * Energy Absorption |||| * Energy Manipulation |||| * Energy-Enhanced Strike |||| * Flight |||| * Gadgets |||| * Intellect |||| * Invulnerability |||| * Leadership |||| * Levitation |||| * Marksmanship |||| * Power Item |||| * Power Suit |||| * Precognition |||| * Stamina |||| * Super Speed |||| * Super Strength |||| * Teleport |||| * Unarmed Combat |||| * Weapon Master |||| |||| Mar-Vell possessed the ability to metabolize solar energy and convert it for a variety of uses, including superhuman strength, the projection of photon energy blasts, and flight. These powers would wane when he was deprived of starlight. Mar-Vell also possessed Cosmic Awareness, which could increase his intellect, granting him limited precognitive powers and the ability to ascertain an opponent's weakness. At one point he also possessed the ability to teleport and cast illusions.",,"Mar-Vell was a white-skinned minority of the blue-skinned Kree empire, but despite discrimination and prejudice, Mar-Vell became a renowned soldier and an acclaimed hero for his victories in battle against the Kree's enemies, notably the Skrulls. |||| |||| Mar-Vell’s regiment, under the command of Yon-Rogg, was given a mission to observe Earth, specifically human’s progress of space travel. Yon-Rogg, jealous of the love between Mar-Vell and the ship’s medic, Una, ordered Mar-Vell to infiltrate Cape Canaveral, Florida, alone. He then secretly tried to fire on Mar-Vell’s ship, but killed a human instead-- Dr. Walter Lawson. Mar-Vell took advantage of resembling Lawson to pose as the doctor and create a secret identity, but Yon-Rogg again secretly tried to kill Mar-Vell by activating the Kree robot, the Sentry. In his Kree uniform, Mar-Vell publicly defeated the robot, and the onlookers acclaimed him as 'Captain Marvel,' misinterpreting what the Sentry called him. |||| |||| Mar-Vell continued to observe humanity, in both his secret and costumed identity, growing increasingly sympathetic for Earth and its inhabitants. His initial adventures were typically extensions of Yon-Rogg’s attempts to kill, discredit, or otherwise destroy him, such as the time Yon-Rogg manipulated Ronan the Accuser to fight Mar-Vell by framing Captain Marvel as a traitor. Mar-Vell also had to navigate the romantic triangle between him and Una and the aggressive attention of his co-worker at the air base, Carol Danvers. These situations came to a head when Una overheard one of Yon-Rogg’s plans to kill Mar-Vell, and she was captured by his agents when she tried to warn him. Although Mar-Vell’s execution failed with the arrival of the Aakon aliens, she was shot in the battle and died in Mar-Vell’s arms as he tried to rescue her. |||| |||| Before he returned to confront Yon-Rogg, he encountered a powerful being named Zo that granted him increased abilities. Around the same time, he ran afoul of Commander Zarek, who hoped to set up Mar-Vell as a traitor. It was he and Ronan that created the illusion of Zo, with which they again manipulated Captain Marvel into thinking he must destroy his home planet Kree-Lar. Marvel was made temporarily a fugitive until Zarek and Ronan were uncovered by the Kree’s Supreme Intelligence. The Supreme Intelligence then revealed to Captain Marvel that it knew of Zarek and Ronan’s treachery the entire time and orchestrated events so that Mar-Vell would be involved in their plot as the Intelligence hoped to use Mar-Vell for even greater things. Claiming Captain Marvel had “passed” these tests, he clothed Mar-Vell in a new costume and allowed him to retain some of his new-found abilities. |||| |||| However, as soon as Captain Marvel left to return to Earth, he instead found himself in the extradimensional realm known as the Negative Zone. The Supreme Intelligence then mentally lured the Earth youth Rick Jones to an abandoned Kree base on Earth in order to bid him to wear the 'Nega-Bands.' By slamming the bands together, Jones and Captain Marvel shared a telepathic link as well as, more importantly, switch places between Earth’s universe and the Negative Zone. In no time at all, Captain Marvel was called out by Yon-Rogg, who was holding Carol Danvers as a hostage. In a last-ditch effort to destroy his rival, Yon-Rogg battled the hero, but Captain Marvel rescued Carol and Yon-Rogg was killed in an explosion as they escaped. (The exposure to Yon-Rogg’s weapon, the Psyche-Magnetron, transformed Carol into Ms. Marvel.) |||| |||| Captain Marvel and Rick Jones continued shared adventures for many months. At one point, Mar-Vell happened upon the idea to use Mister Fantastic’s doorway into the Negative Zone to release Rick and allowing the two to share an existence in the Earth dimension simultaneously. Shortly afterward, both Rick and Marvel were swept up in the intergalactic Kree-Skrull War alongside the Avengers, where Rick encountered the Supreme Intelligence. The Intelligence released the latent psionic potential in Jones’ mind in order to help stop the war, striking all soldiers motionless and teleporting Jones’ allies to the Kree homeworld, among other fantastic feats. Rick was left very near death, and Captain Marvel sacrificed part of his lifeforce to save Jones, “merging atoms” with him so that they could become linked as in their previous relationship. |||| |||| After many more months and many more adventures, Rick Jones’ body could no longer contain both his own lifeforce and that of Mar-Vell, and he collapsed. His girlfriend Lou Ann Savannah took him to her uncle, who used special photonic energy to revive him, and Jones and Captain Marvel could continue to switch places. In fact, Captain Marvel now found he could absorb solar energy and redirect it to fire energy bolts or to exhibit superhuman strength. |||| |||| When Captain Marvel became involved against the plans of the alien nihilist Thanos, he was contacted by Eon, a guardian entity of the universe who commissioned Captain Marvel as the next 'Protector of the Universe.' He also granted him a special “cosmic awareness.” With a newfound title and purpose, he became the primary force against defeating Thanos. In fact, it was his new cosmic awareness that allowed Captain Marvel and the Avengers to defeat the mad Titan, since it gave him insight into Thanos’ use of the Cosmic Cube. Thanos became convinced that he had drained the Cube of its power and discarded it, allowing Captain Marvel to grab the Cube and restore reality to a time before Thanos had gained control over the universe. |||| |||| As time passed, Mar-Vell and Jones overcame the dimension-split between them, existing side-by-side once more, although often they would need to merge in order to maximize Captain Marvel’s power. They adventured in this manner for a long while. When Commander Zarek returned, he led the Lunatic Legion, which included transforming a lowly engineer into the villain Nitro. Nitro was sent to steal canisters of nerve gas when Captain Marvel confronted him. Although Nitro was defeated and Captain Marvel seemed to have re-sealed the canisters before endangering the public, he himself was exposed to the gas, which would later prove disastrous. |||| |||| In a direct conflict with Captain Marvel, Zarek and the Lunatic Legion would have nearly succeeded in bringing him down if it were not for Marvel’s increased powers when merged with Rick Jones. Captain Marvel returned to the Kree homeworld to inform the Supreme Intelligence of the plot, but, surprisingly, the Intelligence revealed its true motives-- that it had known of Zarek’s plan and, in fact, had secretly been a driving force behind nearly all of Captain Marvel’s history. The Supreme Intelligence had long known the Kree had reached an evolutionary dead-end, and its only hope as a species was to integrate other genetically compatible races with its own so as to revitalize the Kree's stagnant development. He had specifically chosen Mar-Vell due to his genetic make-up and had also chosen Rick Jones specifically because of the latent psychic potential he housed. It further arranged to have them both 'bond' by means of the Kree Nega-Bands, a process that was repeated or replicated throughout their history, because the Intelligence knew he couldn’t add Jones' brain to its collective organism directly until it was tempered by contact with a Kree brain such as Mar-Vell's. Using the unique Kree-bred flower called the Millennium Bloom, the Supreme Intelligence then proceeded to try to absorb both Jones' and Mar-Vell's brains, using their bodies as receptacles for its own consciousness in a direct assault against Earth. However, the heroes resisted and managed to escape, and Captain Marvel abandoned the Kree empire permanently. |||| |||| While back on Earth, Mar-Vell wandered independently for a time. He worked at an observatory, became involved with the Defenders for a day, and again teamed up with the Avengers against Thanos. Thanos’ corruption of his home, the moon Titan, pitted the Eternals against the world-computer ISAAC, and Captain Marvel helped the Eternals restore order. During this time, he fell in love with the Eternal’s Elysius, and they began a relationship that spanned both Titan and Earth and many shared adventures. |||| |||| Ultimately, Captain Marvel’s earlier exposure to the nerve gas proved cancerous, and the cancer turned malignant. Mar-Vell spent his last days on Titan, the moon of Saturn, surrounded by Elysius and his friends Mentor and Starfox. Many of his allies came to visit him while on his deathbed including the Thing, Spider-Man, Drax the Destroyer, and an ambassador of the Skrull empire (the greatest enemies of the Kree Empire) who awarded Mar-Vell with the Skrull medal of valor and stated that Captain Marvel was considered to be the greatest single enemy the Skrull Empire had ever known. He was also granted a posthumous honorary membership in the Avengers, and a monument was erected in his memory on Titan. |||| |||| His heroic legacy includes his son, Genis-Vell, conceived by Elysius who impregnated herself with Mar-Vell's cloned DNA, and Phyla-Vell, a daughter from an alternate reality whose history became folded into reality after a time warp. Monica Rambeau has also used the alias of Captain Marvel. |||| Mar-Vell is apparently plucked out of space/time after his battle with Nitro but before he starts to show signs of his illness. Although he appears healthy, Mar-Vell is made aware that his body harbors the cancer that will one day kill him. Nevertheless, Mar-Vell dons his Nega Bands in order to serve as the warden of the new Negative Zone prison. He is later called in to help the Pro-registration heroes who revived him, in the final battle of the Civil War; however upon seeing the chaos they are causing, he departs, to France, where he spends all of his time observing a painting of Alexander the Great in the Louvre and contemplates Alexander's similarities to himself. He is eventually called back to action, first to defend the museum from the supervillain known as the Cyclone who he readily kills, for murdering several people. He is eventually tracked down by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Heather Santos, who tells him Tony Stark wants to have him return to his own timeline, and persuades him to take action. He then returns to New York, where he helps the Avengers defeat a giant robot. Simultaneously a woman he saved during the final battle of the Civil War, starts a cult which worships Mar-Vell, under the assumed name of Mother Starr. |||| |||| It has been implied that this Captain Marvel may in fact be a Skrull; at the same time that Skrull infiltrators strike S.H.I.E.L.D., S.W.O.R.D., the Baxter Building and a number of Stark Enterprises facilities, 'Mar-Vell' launches an attack on Thunderbolt Mountain. Brian Reed has stated that an eight-page story within the one-shot Secret Invasion: Who Do You Trust? will shed some light on what has happened to Mar-Vell between the final issue of his limited series and both Secret Invasion #1 and Thunderbolts. |||| |||| It was confirmed that 'Mar-Vell' was formerly a Skrull named Khn'nr, who received memory implants. Due to an error in the methods of Skrull scientists, the personality of Mar-Vell as well as all of Mar-Vell's memories prior to his Skrull captivity were retained in their entirety even after the psychological trigger was activated which was supposed to return him to his Skrull persona. It was further explained that most of Khn'nr's personality had accidentally been erased as a byproduct of the botched mental conditioning. Consequently, the Mar-vell persona remained defiantly dominant. When he learned the truth he decided to rebel against the Skrulls and protect Earth from their invasion. ||||"

3536,Tigra (Marvel),Greer Nelson ,3536_20060911043742_char.jpg,"Tigra possesses superhuman strength, agility, and senses.","Tigra suffers from conflicts between her human nature and her feline aspects.  Occasionally, she becomes violently hostile or over-amorous.","When policeman's widow Greer Nelson couldn't find a job, her old physics professor hired her as a lab assistant. When Hydra attempted to kidnap Dr. Joanne Tumulo, Greer leapt to her defense. Greer was fatally shot with an 'alpha radiation' pistol. Her mentor revealed that she was a member of a race of humanoids, mystically evolved from cats. She offered to save Greer, by making her one of them. Greer agreed. In a mystic ritual, a feline soul was bonded with her failing body.  The combined being resembled one of the legendary warriors of the Cat People, so she was named Tigra. Although able to return to her human form with the aid of an enchanted amulet, Tigra preferred her feline form and abandoned her previous identity. Although she has served with the Avengers and the West Coast Avengers, she briefly worked in the New York City police, using the pseudonym Greer Sorenson, in order to bring the Brethren of the Blue Fist to justice for its role in the death of her husband. |||| |||| During the Civil War, Tigra supported the registration act, although she expressed sincere concern about the fate of Captain America and the other heroes who opposed the Act and turned fugitive. |||| Subsequently as a registered hero and agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., she served as an instructor in Camp Hammond and resumed her relationship with Hank Pym, unaware that he was in fact a Skrull. |||| After beating a criminal gang including Jigsaw, Tigra was attacked at her home by The Hood and his fledgling team of villains. Tigra was made an example of their power: she was shot, severely beaten and had her cat amulet stolen - all while being filmed. The Hood threatened to kill her mother if she crossed them again. The Hood and his entire crew later reappeared at her apartment, demanding to know the location of the New Avengers' secret headquarters so they could exact revenge for a defeat at their hands. Tigra intentionally gave him information that led them into an ambush. She joined in the battle and personally beat down the Hood, saving the life of Iron Fist in the process. |||| Tigra continued to serve in the Initiative as a senior staff member of the central organization, and was the leader of the Arkansas Initiative team 'The Battalion.' She briefly fought alongside She-Hulk’s team of Lady Liberators as they battled Red Hulk. |||| After the end of the Skrull Invasion, Tigra learned that she had become pregnant by the Skrull posing as Hank Pym. Fearing she would give birth to a full-blown Skrull she decided to terminate the pregnancy, although during a fight with the cyborg clone of Thor (Ragnarok) her actions and sudden concern for her unborn child's well-being suggested that she might not be going through with the abortion and would instead end up giving birth to the child. |||| The arrival of Norman Osborn signaled the closure of Camp Hammond. Norman Osborn however had other plans for Tigra, having learned of her pregnancy from Trauma's files. Tigra explained to him that she had yet to make a final decision.

Under his original Guardsman name of Quasar, he was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix Lilandra from her insane brother, then-Majestor D'Ken. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor. |||| |||| Quasar was later amongst those Imperial Guard members who allied themselves with the treacherous Shi'ar High Council member Lord Samédàr who was aiding an attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by Deathbird. Even after the ploy was discovered, Quasar, like most of the other Guard members present, still chose to side with Samédàr against the X-Men who were defending then-Empress Lilandra. |||| |||| Later, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne, Quasar was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as Excalibur and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named Rachel Summers. |||| |||| During the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires, Quasar - under his new Guardsman name of Neutron - was part of a small team of Guardsmen who were charged with preventing the member of the Earth team of super-powered beings known as the Avengers named Quasar from retrieving the legendary Nega-Bands of the Kree warrior Captain Mar-vell, which had been stolen. Neutron has since had a long-standing grudge against the Avenger named Quasar, and once teamed up with the Russian super-being known as the Presence to seek his revenge. |||| |||| Neutron was also amongst those Imperial Guard members who defended Lilandra against an assassination attempt by the Kree Ronan the Accuser and his unwilling agents, the royal family of the Earth race known as the Inhumans. |||| |||| Following a meeting of the intergalactic council, Earth was declared a threat to the entire cosmos and consequently it was deemed to turn the planet into an intergalactic prison. Criminals from numerous alien races were teleported to Earth, among them the former Imperial Guard members who had allied themselves with Deathbird and Lord Samédàr all those years ago. These former Guardsmen had allied themselves with a lone member of the alien D'bari, calling himself Starhammer, who sought revenge on Jean Grey for the crimes of Dark Phoenix."

8521,Melter (Marvel)(01 - Bruno Horgan),Bruno Horgan ,8521_20070329231921_char.jpg,"Bruno Horgan is an accomplished engineer and businessman. |||| |||| The Melter's primary weapon was his melting device, which in essence turned objects from solid to liquid by distrupting their molecular cohesion (rather than using pure heat). His original devices only affected iron, but as time went by, he acquired more sophisticated technology, including a melting gun developed by Stark Industries-- employing a 'variable frequency microwave generator' capable of melting, depending on exposure and mode, metal, stone, wood, and even flesh. Originally, he incorporated the device into a chest-mounted projector, then developed it as a gun. Finally, he used it on his belt. He also could project the beam from his helmet, although it was only effective at close range.",,"What began as petty revenge turned into a matter of pride and finally into pure obsession. Bruno Horgan was once at the top of his field, providing weapons and munitions the U.S. government. Unfortunately, his penchant for cutting corners lost him his contract when safety inspectors closed him down for using inferior materials. Instead, the contract went to his competitor, Stark Industries, owned by Tony Stark (aka: Iron Man). During the dismantling of his factory, Horgan happened upon a malfunctioning radar device that projected a beam that melted iron materials. He perfected the device, incorporating it into a costume, and became the Melter. Immediately going on a rampage, sabotaging Stark’s factories, he was confronted by Iron Man and defeated. |||| |||| The Melter was freed by Baron Zemo to help form the original Masters of Evil as a counterpart for the Avengers’ Iron Man. However, Zemo’s plan, to destroy the Avengers and hold New York in thrall, failed, and the Melter was beaten by Iron Man once again. He was freed again to join the Masters in an assault on the Avengers while Zemo fought Captain America in South America but again failed to defeat them. He next joined the Masters when the team was organized by the Crimson Cowl (secretly Ultron), and although they initially were successful, the Masters were betrayed by the Black Knight. |||| |||| Prior to this last outing with the Masters of Evil, the Melter was among those villains summoned by Doctor Doom to crash the wedding of Reed Richards and the Susan Storm thanks to his powerful Emotion Charger device. Richards was able to use a device from Uatu The Watcher to send all villains away with no memory of the event. After this, the Melter re-designed his weapon in the form of a gun and boosted its power to affect all metals as well as other materials. He sought revenge on Iron Man but was again defeated. |||| |||| After his career with the Masters of Evil, the Melter joined with Whiplash and Man-Bull in forming the Death Squad out of their mutual obsession to defeat Iron Man. They confronted him at a comic book convention but were quickly trounced. His obsession unabated and his weapon further updated, he tried another villain team-up, this time with Whiplash and the Blizzard, all three receiving financial support by Justin Hammer. They robbed a casino where Tony Stark was dating Bethany Cabe, but the couple foiled the villains, who were remanded to Ryker’s Island. Freed by Hammer’s associates, the Melter joined Hammer’s army of villains guarding his Mediterranean “house boat” base. When Iron Man was framed for murder by Hammer, Tony Stark allowed his armor to be impounded as malfunctioning and tracked Hammer to his headquarters. With a spare Iron Man suit, Stark defeated Hammer’s army, forcing Hammer to escape but imprisoning his agents. |||| |||| While in jail, Bruno came up with new specifications for his melting ray with help from a fellow prisoner, a nuclear physicist who had been convicted for tax evasion. Designing it specifically for Iron Man’s latest armor, he spent no time tracking down Iron Man once released. Ironically, Iron Man was wearing an old suit of armor that remained unaffected by the Melter’s beam, and he was defeated once again. |||| |||| Having been defeated physically time and again left the Melter felling defeated more and more emotionally. He hoped to earn a more fearsome reputation by killing the Thing, who at the time was hospitalized after his battle with the Champion. However, nearly two dozen other villains hoped to also kill or capture the Thing, and they were kept at bay by dozens of heroes, each doing what they could to help their staunch friend recover in peace. |||| |||| Ever persistant in his obsession, the Melter returned to work on an yet more powerful version of his melting ray, but after completing it, he was shot by an assassin of the Scourge of the Underworld who was posing as the Melter’s assistant. ||||"

In this one's history, her father had instead been murdered that night, and she had continued her career as Batgirl... eventually pursuing a successful romantic and sexual relationship with Batman. Harvey Dent had become the Police Commissioner, and the Batman Family was constantly under fire from the authorities. She was also surprised to see the newer Robin, Tim Drake. Confused and displaced from her own world, she helped out as best as she could during the Crisis in Gotham City. Her home timeline was eventually destroyed.

Green Arrow explained how the absolute power had corrupted Parallax's soul.

This suit heightens his senses, gives him the power of flight and the ability to travel in space without a vehicle.",,"A human archaeologist, Adam Strange wanders into a beam of light near an excavation site in South America.  Unbeknownst to him, this 'Zeta Beam' is of alien origin, and it immediately transports him to its source:  the planet Rann.  There, he promptly meets Alanna, the woman destined to be his wife, and her father, Sardath, the man that will provide the technological toys that turn him into the 'Defender of Rann'.  His trips to Rann are typically of limited duration, though, because the Zeta beam works by irradiating its passengers.  Once that radiation wears off, Strange finds himself back on Earth.  The beam comes to Earth at regular intervals, however, so he can, at least, know where and when to place himself so as to return to Rann.   Stories tend to stress his status as a 'man of two worlds', who spends the unfortunate bulk of his time on Earth--the one without his beloved Alanna. His most frequent ally has historically been the various Hawkpeople since the dawn of the Silver Age.  This perhaps unusual partnership has typically been explained by the fact that, on Earth, Hawkman and Adam Strange have practiced archeology when not superheroing.   Also, the Hawks and Adam Strange have forged a bond over the similarities of their lives as superheroes:  both are defending adopted planets. However, since 2004, DC has reworked things so as to display a relationship between the planets of Rann and Thanagar themselves--as the title Rann-Thanagar War suggests-- and it is currently uncertain what impact this inter-societal conflict will have on the interpersonal relationships of Hawkman/woman/girl and Adam Strange."

149,She-Hulk (Marvel)(01 - Jennifer Walters),Jennifer Walters ,149_20060316070417_char.jpg,"She-Hulk possesses immense superhuman strength, capable of lifting in excess of 100 tons. During “savage” periods (which unlike her cousin, are not brought on by anger or emotions of any kind, but rather outside forces, such as the manipulation of The Scarlet Witch during the Avengers Disassembled storyline or the manipulation of the gamma radiation which allows her to be She-Hulk in the first place), her strength levels drastically increase. She possesses an incredibly high level of durability, making her impervious to most injuries and disease, as well as making her resistant to extreme temperature variations. She-Hulk also possesses a healing factor which allows her to rapidly heal and regenerate from most serious injuries she incurs (she was able to heal from a serious stomach wound inflicted by the Wendigo in a matter of minutes). Her immense strength allows her the ability to jump upwards of 600 feet high and about 1000 feet across. |||| |||| She-Hulk is apparently also able to swap physiques with other humans using Ovoid mind techniques. This ability however, was introduced during John Byrne’s infamous fourth-wall breaking run on Sensational She-Hulk, and has not been seen in use, or even mentioned, since. Whether She-Hulk actually possesses this ability is in question. |||| |||| She-Hulk is also skilled in a number of unspecified martial arts techniques after being trained by Gamora, and unlike earlier in her super-hero career where she preferred to simply use her strength to fight (even though she was a competent hand-to-hand combatant after being trained by Captain America), she now regularly employs these skills in battle. |||| |||| In addition to the powers and skills mentioned above, She-Hulk is also a highly skilled and competent lawyer.",,"Jennifer Walters, the meek and mousy lawyer cousin of Bruce Banner, was the daughter of Sheriff Morris Walters. Agents of Nicholas Trask, a crime boss who had crossed paths with her father, shot and seriously wounded her on a day when her cousin was in town. Bruce gave her a blood transfusion, as no other donors of her blood type were available; the radioactive blood mutated Jennifer as it had her cousin, transforming her into the She-Hulk. |||| |||| Although Jennifer was at first savage while in her form as She-Hulk, she eventually gained the same intelligence she had as the normal Jennifer Walters. She quickly came to appreciate the confidence and assertiveness that had come with being She-Hulk. For a long time, she felt more comfortable in her form as She-Hulk than in her 'normal' form as Jennifer. But she has gradually grown comfortable in both forms, and realized that she has much to offer the world in both her forms. After a brief solo career, she joined the Avengers and temporarily replaced the Thing in the Fantastic Four. |||| |||| During her tenure with the Fantastic Four, the She-Hulk had to prevent a radiation leak in a downed S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. This radiation exposure apparently mutated Jennifer to the point that she could not transform back into her original form. But this was an agreeable turn of events for her, since she preferred her She-Hulk form anyway. It was revealed much later that the 'genetic block' was in fact purely psychological, shortly before a similar block locked her in non-Hulk form. That block proved to be temporary. |||| |||| After the Fantastic Four , the She-Hulk rejoined the Avengers and joined the staff of District Attorney Blake Tower, where she met Louise 'Weezi' Mason, formerly the Golden Age super heroine called the Blonde Phantom; during this period, she discovered that Mason had manipulated Towers into hiring She-Hulk so that Mason could again star in a comic book and thus avoid dying of old age. Mason's husband, also a former comic book character, had passed away three years ago, but other, more popular characters from the era, such as Captain America and Namor the Sub-Mariner, were still around. |||| |||| While doing some legal work for Heroes for Hire, she also went on a few adventures with them and spent some time dating Luke Cage. Later She-Hulk was a member of the short lived hero group the Fantastic Force. |||| |||| Jennifer currently works as a lawyer for the Superhuman Law division of the New York law firm of Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg, & Holliway. Now able to change forms at will again, Jennifer is rediscovering she sometimes has wildly different views and opinions in each form."

This android battled the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, Iron Man (Tony Stark), and the space knight Rom on the Thinker's behalf, meeting defeat each time. Disgusted, the Thinker ordered the Android to remain out of his sight. The Android deactivated in a Mayfield, Ohio barn, briefly fighting Captain America upon discovery until revealing that it would shut down if left alone. Eventually reprogrammed by the synthetic Super-Adaptoid, which had the copied the Fixer's technological skill, it fought Avengers solo and with the Heavy Metal robot team before being decapitated by Namor. The Android's body was placed in a special containment facility in Fort Meade, Maryland. Some time later, the Android was sent by Machinesmith to distract the reserve Avengers while other synthetic villains escaped confinement. It was neutralized by Captain Marvel (Monica Rambeau) and Firebird. The Thinker eventually reclaimed the Android and sent it to kidnap Franklin Richards, whose parents were stranded on an alternate Earth. The Thunderbolts prevented the abduction, defeating the Android and a robotic Thinker replica. The Android was placed as an exhibit on the convention floor (as back-up in the Thinker and Red Skull's plot to enslave the Avengers with microbial nanites) at San Diego's Comic-Con International, but the Fantastic Four foiled the villains' plans. The Gideon Trust later used the Android as a security device in their New York City headquarters, the Gideon Tower, where it battled Human Torch (Johnny Storm), She-Hulk (Jen Walters), Namorita, and Ant-Man (Scott Lang). |||| |||| |||| Somehow the Android developed sentience, and the New York law firm of Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg, & Holliway emancipated it from Thinker, got it American citizenship, and hired it.

When a robotic Thinker replica orchestrated a breakout at the experimental super-villain prison the Big House, Andy rejected his former master's orders and turned on him. Most recently, when Titania (Mary MacPherran) attacked the law firm, Andy intervened and was decapitated.

Her belt contains plastic explosives.",,"Natalia Romanova, known to most as Natasha Romanoff, is rumored to be a relative of the Romanoffs, the last ruling czars of Russia, but nothing else is known of her family. During World War II, a Nazi assault upon Stalingrad set the building she was in on fire. A woman, possibly her mother, threw her into the arms of a Russian soldier named Ivan Petrovich before being consumed by the flames. |||| |||| Ivan brought Natasha under his protection and soon had to defend her from her many enemies. In 1941, Natasha was sought by the Nazi Baron Strucker, who presented her to the Hand to become their master assassin. She was saved from Strucker and the Hand by Ivan, the American super-hero Captain America, and the Canadian adventurer Logan. |||| |||| Under Ivan's care, Natasha grew to pursue her goal of becoming a ballet dancer and studied under Oksana Bolishinko, a famous Bolshoi instructor. She fell in love with a Soviet test pilot named Alexi Shostakov but was grief-stricken when he apparently died testing an experimental rocket. Natasha decided that she would honor Alexi's memory by becoming an intelligence operative, not realizing that this was what the K.G.B. had hoped would happen when they informed her of Alexi’s death. She was instructed by the K.G.B. in their infamous Red Room Academy and under their training, she became their most skilled operative, a superb fighter and information-gatherer. The K.G.B. gave her the code name of 'Black Widow,' and quickly sent her into the field. |||| |||| When Logan resurfaced in America, now bereft of his memory, Natasha set out as the Black Widow to save him from a team of HYDRA assassins. She soon encountered Logan again when he, Ben Grimm, and Carol Danvers stole the Red Storm Project from Russia. Natasha pursued them but was ordered off by her superiors. |||| |||| The Black Widow's first encounter with Iron Man came when she was directed to slay Anton Vanko, the creator of the Soviet Crimson Dynamo armor, who had defected to America. Natasha attempted to distract Tony Stark while her partner Boris Turgenov used the Crimson Dynamo to destroy Stark's plants. Turgenov and Vanko wound up perishing in battle, and Natasha remained in America to find some way of regaining the K.G.B.'s favor. |||| |||| Since Tony Stark was still unaware that she was a K.G.B. operative, she continued to romance him so that she could steal a new anti-gravity device he had created. She managed to use the device to commit various acts of sabotage, even lifting entire buildings into the air, but Iron Man nullified the device and she barely escaped capture, now unable to trick Stark into lowering his guard. |||| |||| By luck, Natasha happened upon the new costumed crime fighter Hawkeye, who had been mistaken for a criminal by the police. Hawkeye was so taken with Natasha that she was able to entice him into an attempt at stealing plans from Tony Stark. Hawkeye fought Iron Man while Natasha watched from a distance, but when Iron Man deflected one of Hawkeye's explosive arrows, the force of the impact struck Natasha down, knocking her unconscious. Hawkeye fled the scene to help Natasha recover. |||| |||| After Natasha recovered, her superiors instructed her to avoid Stark Industries for a time and directed her instead to target Williams Innovations. She duped Hawkeye into assaulting that firm, but Spider-Man intervened and Hawkeye turned back as he had begun to suspect his lover's true motivations. Natasha later sent Hawkeye out on a second attempt to steal Stark's plans. However, while Hawkeye was gone, she was kidnapped by the K.G.B. and returned to Russia. The K.G.B. designed a new costume for her and equipped her with her 'widow's bite' and 'widow's line'. With these new weapons Natasha joined Hawkeye in battle against Iron Man in an attempt to destroy him, but when Iron Man shocked Natasha with an electrical blast Hawkeye disobeyed her orders to save her life once again. The K.G.B. then returned and stole Natasha away from Hawkeye. |||| |||| This time the K.G.B. brainwashed Natasha to ensure her loyalty to the state; in her next mission, she found herself allied against Hawkeye, who had become a member of the Avengers. Her love for Hawkeye allowed her to resist the brainwashing, and she finally turned against the K.G.B. She became an ally of the Avengers for awhile, aiding them against the Sons of the Serpent. She also proved instrumental in defeating the alien Ultroids who were certain the Avengers would not kill their leader Ixar because of their oath against killing, but Natasha forced Ixar to surrender, reasoning that as she was not an Avenger, she was not bound by their oaths. |||| |||| On an assignment for S.H.I.E.L.D., Natasha discovered that Alexi Shostakov was still alive, and had been transformed by the K.G.B. into the costumed hero, the Red Guardian. She and the Avengers opposed the Red Guardian and his masters, and Alexi died in the battle. For a while Natasha abandoned her identity as the Black Widow, just as the Avengers were about to make her an official member. |||| |||| Natasha finally decided to resume the Black Widow identity, but soon broke off her relationship with Hawkeye so that she could pursue a solo career. She adopted a new all-black uniform and became a vigilante, battling street gangs and organized crime in New York. Ivan had come to America by then, and he served as her chauffeur and confidant. Her new methods of operation brought her into contact with Daredevil, and she soon developed both a professional and personal relationship with him, while into battle side by side as they fell in love. |||| |||| Natasha was less taken with Matt's law partner Foggy Nelson, who was manipulated by the villain Mr. Kline into prosecuting her for the murder of the Scorpion (it was actually a robot of the Scorpion created by Mr. Kline). Although Natasha was proven innocent, she never truly forgave Foggy for the savagery of his courtroom assault. |||| |||| Matt broke up with his long-time love, Karen Page, so that he could be with Natasha, and the two of them moved to San Francisco to start a new life together. They fought against menaces such as Man-Bull, Blue Talon, Dark Messiah, Angar the Screamer, Ramrod, Terrex, Kraven the Hunter, Death-Stalker, Owl, el Jaguar, HYDRA, and Damon Dran, the Indestructible Man. |||| |||| Natasha wanted to find a new career for herself beyond the day-to-day adventures she and Daredevil enjoyed, and attempted to become a fashion designer, but her career never took off, and her relationship with Matt became strained. Natasha left Daredevil briefly to accept an offer of membership in the Avengers after aiding them against Magneto, but she soon left them after determining from a battle against the Lion God that she did not fit into a team environment. Natasha and Matt reconciled for awhile, but after a lengthy romance, Natasha finally broke up with Matt because she felt he did not treat her as an equal in battle. |||| |||| Still on the West Coast, Natasha joined forces with Ghost Rider (John Blaze) and Angel and Iceman of the X-Men when the gods Hercules and Venus were captured by the armies of Pluto and Ares. After having saved Hercules from a forced marriage, he joined the four heroes to found a new super-hero team, the Champions. Based in Los Angeles and bankrolled by the Angel, the team enjoyed modest success in their adventures. During this time, Natasha became involved with Hercules, but his perspective as an immortal made a long-term relationship seem unimportant. The Champions finally disbanded due to bankruptcy. |||| |||| Although she and Daredevil had parted ways, the Black Widow was still well-known to Daredevil's enemies as a woman he had loved, and Natasha was captured by Bullseye to be used as bait in an attempt to slay Daredevil. However, Natasha escaped her bonds and aided Daredevil in defeating Bullseye. |||| |||| Damon Dran, one of Natasha's enemies from her days with Daredevil, captured Ivan in order to lure Natasha to his island, where he set an army of female combat specialists against her. Dran intended to send an agent impersonating the Black Widow to infiltrate the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier and assassinate Nick Fury, but Natasha defeated his agents, warned Fury, and saved Ivan from Dran before S.H.I.E.L.D. bombed Dran's island. |||| |||| The Black Widow was once more embroiled in the schemes of the Hand when she attempted to prevent them from stealing the body of their master warrior, Kirigi, from the morgue. The Hand struck Natasha down with poisons that killed her, but Stone of the Chaste restored her to life. She joined forces with Daredevil and Stone against the Hand when they attempted to revive Elektra. Natasha guessed at the time that Elektra had been successfully revived, but kept this from Matt for his own good. |||| |||| When Natasha learned that Oksana Bolishinko, her old instructor, was in America at the Russian Embassy, she broke her way into the premises, seeking to apologize to her mentor for abandoning the ballet to become a spy. Oskana replied that Natasha was not the only pupil of hers who had been stolen away by the K.G.B., and that she accepted that espionage was Natasha's true calling. |||| |||| Russian agents then created a Life Model Decoy (LMD) of Alexi Shostakov, which they used to dupe Natasha into believing her husband was still alive. With threats of terminating Alexi, they coerced her into performing acts of espionage for Russia against the U.S. Upon gaining the desired technology, the Russians revealed the truth and tried to kill the Widow, but with the aid of Ivan, she defeated them and destroyed the LMD. |||| |||| Natasha later joined forces with Iron Man to prevent the Russian sleeper agent code named 'Oktober' from launching nuclear missiles which would have caused World War III. Unknown to Natasha, she herself was Oktober, and succeeded in launching the missiles. Fortunately, Iron Man prevented them from being detonated and aided Natasha in capturing the K.G.B. agent responsible for Natasha's reprogramming. The Widow also worked alongside Daredevil against the murdering telepath known as Rose, who had targeted other telepaths, including several members of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s ESPer unit. |||| |||| Natasha eventually returned to the Avengers and assumed the mantle of leadership, usually managing the team's operations from Avengers Mansion while allowing the Black Knight to lead in the field. During this time she also became attracted to Captain America, but wound up sleeping with Tony Stark instead. Her tenure as the Avengers' leader came to a sorrowful end when most of the team was apparently slain battling Onslaught. Unable to rebuild the Avengers roster herself, and threatened with legal action from the Maria Stark Foundation, the Black Widow allowed the Avengers to dissolve. |||| |||| Considering herself to be the last Avenger, Natasha embarked upon a personal mission to bring down all of the Avengers' former enemies, including the Grey Gargoyle and Masters of Evil. She again encountered Daredevil at this time, who was concerned with her mental state as he witnessed her obsessive hunting of the Grey Gargoyle. Natasha's presence in Daredevil's life again complicated his relationship with Karen Page, which at that time was still being rebuilt. Although Natasha was willing to rekindle their relationship, she acknowledged that Karen was the woman Matt loved and nobly allowed them their space. Later on, she even offered to assist Karen after she had been framed for murder by Mr. Fear. |||| |||| Natasha was also the first person to correctly identify the former members of the Masters of Evil who had adopted the guise of the heroic Thunderbolts. She attempted to turn M.A.C.H.-1 and Songbird against Baron Zemo before he could make his move, inspiring them by telling them how Hawkeye, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch had redeemed their own criminal identities, but Zemo set his plan into motion before they could reach a decision. |||| |||| The Avengers finally returned and resumed their operations, but the Black Widow has only occasionally assisted them on missions, still feeling responsible for the team's disbanding. Instead, she has focused on her espionage work. Natasha has accepted several more assignments from S.H.I.E.L.D., such as impersonating the terrorist leader Ebon Flame in order to shut down her organization, Freedom's Light. She also had Iron Man assist her in infiltrating the forced-labor camp for scientists run by Tuatara under the Mandarin's direction. |||| |||| Natasha came close to learning some truths about her past when she was led into a trap by a man named Vindiktor, who claimed to have a copy of Natasha's mother's diary. This turned out to be false, but as Natasha fought him, he claimed that he was her brother. Unfortunately, Vindiktor died during their battle before Natasha could ascertain if he was telling the truth. |||| |||| Natasha crossed Daredevil's path again when he attempted to slay Baby Karen, believing the infant to be the Anti-Christ. Natasha saved the child, but was badly beaten by Daredevil in the ensuing fight. Karen Page ultimately died protecting the child, and Matt went to Natasha to be consoled and to explain his earlier actions to her. Natasha reconciled with Matt, revealing that she still loved him, but noted that they had grown too far apart to become a couple again. |||| |||| Recently, Natasha became aware of the presence of another Black Widow, a younger woman named Yelena Belova who had also been trained at the Red Room. Yelena was obsessed with being the sole Black Widow; the two Black Widows first encountered each other while attempting to retrieve the Endless Fury bio weapon created in Rhapistan, which exploded violently. Natasha later had herself and Yelena trade appearances through plastic surgery to help teach Yelena that her superiors considered her expendable. |||| |||| Despite the presence of the other Black Widow, Natasha Romanoff remains one of the world's most accomplished hand-to-hand combatants, and is quite possibly the most skilled espionage agent alive, still in high demand with S.H.I.E.L.D. Her most recent S.H.I.E.L.D. assignment has been to trace the whereabouts of the Tinkerer during a plot to investigate the financing of super-villains in America by foreign nations, possibly Latveria."

Part of the division of the Imperial Guard known as the Superguardians, Starbolt was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix Lilandra from her insane brother, then-Majestor D'ken. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor. During the clash, Starbolt became enraged when he saw the feral X-Man Wolverine attacking his teammate and then-lover Oracle. After Starbolt flash-fried him, Wolverine quickly took the two lovers out of the fight by slamming them into each other. |||| |||| Starbolt was also one of eight Imperial Guardsmen chosen to battle the X-Men over the fate of Phoenix, a primal force of the cosmos that had assumed the form of the X-Man Jean Grey. |||| |||| Soon after, Starbolt was amongst those few Imperial Guard members who opposed the treacherous Shi'ar High Council member Lord Samédàr who was aiding an attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by Deathbird. Even after many of the Guard chose to side with Samédàr, Starbolt remained steadfast in his loyalty to then-Empress Lilandra. |||| |||| Later, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne, Starbolt was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as Excalibur and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named Rachel Summers. |||| |||| Much later, the intergalactic teleporter Lila Cheney transported the X-Men to the Shi'ar Empire at the behest of then-Empress Deathbird in time to see Lilandra regain her throne. Not all was as it seemed, however, as in reality a group of Warskrulls, using technology to allow them to duplicate superpowers, had captured and impersonated the X-Men's founder, the telepathic Professor Charles Xavier, using his telepathy to control Lilandra and the Imperial Guard, including Starbolt. After the ruse was discovered by the X-Men and all the Warskrull impostors were exposed, Lilandra settled matters with Deathbird, discovering her sister did not want the throne anymore. |||| |||| During the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires, Starbolt was part of a small team of Guardsmen who were charged with preventing the member of the Earth team of super-powered beings known as the Avengers named Quasar from retrieving the legendary Nega-Bands of the Kree warrior Captain Mar-vell, which had been stolen. |||| |||| Subsequently, Starbolt was amongst those Imperial Guard members who defended Lilandra against an assassination attempt by the Kree Ronan the Accuser and his unwilling agents, the royal family of the Earth race known as the Inhumans."

Garbed as Ant-Man, Lang broke into Cross Technological Enterprises and discovered that Dr. Sondheim, the only person capable of helping his daughter, was being held prisoner. He rescued the doctor and was relieved when Sondheim was able to save the life of his beloved Cassie. |||| |||| Lang had intended to return the Ant-Man costume to Pym and turn himself in for its theft but Pym, aware of the use to which Lang had put the stolen goods, offered to let him keep them, provided he only use them to uphold the law. |||| |||| Shortly after, Lang donned the Ant-Man costume on various occasions to assist Iron Man and the Avengers, and briefly was hired by the Fantastic Four when Reed Richards was missing and presumed dead. |||| |||| After Lang's ex-wife gained custody of their daughter Cassie, Lang accepted an offer to join the Avengers officially.

Only team leader, Mister Immortal, was able to hear her. In fact, the two had a romantic relationship which is probably one reason why she had a calming effect on him when he went into one of his uncontrollable rages. As all of the other Great Lakes Avengers, Dinah Soar had not been taken seriously by the rest of the superhuman community that were aware of her existence, but her aerial acrobatics were nothing to scoff at. She had fought side by side with her teammates against such foes as Deadpool, the Thunderbolts, and Graviton, but it was only during the battle against Maelstrom that her concern for her injured lover led her to be distracted long enough for Maelstrom to deliver a killing blow.

He is beloved across Asgard, by all creatures large and small. He's a natural warrior with skills that surpass even my own. |||| |||| Like the mythological version, the Marvel Balder is the catalyst that will trigger Ragnarok and end Asgard. This almost happened when Loki had the blind god Hoder accidentally kill Balder, but is averted by the planning of Odin, who later restores Balder to life. |||| |||| Balder once traveled alone in the land of the dead, seeing many horrifying things, including souls of some of the men he had personally killed. Returning to Asgard, he was a traumatized shell of his former self. His recovery was supervised by Volstagg, a member of the Warriors Three. |||| |||| Balder also has a love-hate relationship with Karnilla, the Queen of the Norns, who has aided both Loki and Asgard at times. Karnilla's lust for Balder inadvertently causes the death of Balder's current love, Nanna - an act that Balder has never forgotten. |||| |||| Balder would spend time as a loyal companion of Eric Masterson, who was wielding the power of Thor. In one incident, as Eric battles the murderous Blooddaxe, Balder runs interference, saving the lives of many nearby policemen. Soon after this battle, Balder and Eric willingly enter Mephisto's realm, to assist Sif. This was done despite both knowing Eric had lost his powers after the battle with Bloodaxe. |||| |||| With the exception of Thor, Volstag, Hogun, Fandral and Heimdal, Balder and all other Asgardians are currently dead, having died during the final Ragnarok. |||| |||| *** IN ASGARD *** |||| Balder remained in Asgard for many years and fought alongside Thor for many more battles. |||| |||| He even helped out Greyval Grimson returning the Raven Banner of Asgard, because Greyval's wife, valkirior Sygnet request he could talk with lord Odin.

Thor eventually returned from his seeming death and returned to Asgard. Balder helped Thor deal with the loss of his father after he had been slain by Surtur . As of these events, Thor became the ruler of Asgard. A difficult task in witch Balder helped him to make the dessicions that he stood for as a king. Eventually Thor brought Asgard to Earth, hoping to inspire the people living there. While Balder was not sure of this dessicion, he supported Thor anyway.

Superman and Green Lantern were just beginning to investigate the disturbing disappearance of Pluto and the even more distressing engine ion trail associated with Warworld, when they stumbled across Maxima, her people, and the super-villain Massacre. |||| |||| After a battle full of wounded pride, Maxima eventually conceded her position when Almerac's rendezvous showed up using a Boom Tube. She explained that she was leading her people to safety from Imperiex, the force that conquered her world. Massacre had seemed to meet his death back in Superman #106, however somehow Maxima came across him and described her association in these words, 'Massacre serves only me now'. To save her people she allied herself with Darkseid's son, Grayven, who was taking them to regions unknown. This was also being undertaken without the knowledge of Darkseid. Maxima left Superman with these words: 'Mark my words, when Imperiex comes for your precious home world, you'll see alliances you've never dreamed of.' |||| |||| All that Maxima warned eventually came to fruition as she and a myriad of other characters (both heroes and villains) formed alliances with Earth and Apokolips in an effort to destroy Imperiex (Man of Steel # 115). |||| |||| Maxima ultimately met her demise in an heroic effort to put her ship between the destructive beams of Brainiac 13's Warworld which would have resulted in the destruction of the entire universe (Man of Steel #117). However, it has been theorized that Maxima did not die, but one of her duplicate simulacrums, as seen in Extreme Justice #10. |||| |||| History and Power description from Wiki page."

3123,Controller (Marvel),Basil Sandhurst ,3123_20051225145715_char.jpg,The Controller possess super-human strength originating from his stainless steel exo-skeleton/body armor that has been micro-surgically attached to his body from head to toe.,,"As a child, Basil Sandhurst grew up plagued with sickness and often lay bed-ridden for months. He grew up to become a scientist as a result of this childhood-- one where he often felt life was never under his control. However, his unorthodox practices and theories, all about harnessing the power of the human mind, only served to bar him from working with any legitimate research center. Instead, his brother Vincent managed to use his influence as a lawyer for Cord Industries to get Basil a job there. Vincent, himself less than scrupulous, hoped Basil would help him take over the company, but when Basil went on a rampage in the lab, Vincent accidentally pushed him into some experimental chemicals. The resultant explosion scarred and crippled Basil, leaving him once more bed-ridden and weak. |||| |||| Out of guilt, Vincent set his brother up in an automated house and laboratory using money embezzled from Cord Industries. Basil eventually used the equipment to fashion a exoskeleton that would finally allow himself freedom of movement and control over his own destiny. In fact, he became determined to control the world. Using a Mental-Wave Absorbatron, Basil could tap into the mental energy of his victims and beam it to his exoskeleton, and the “slave discs” would help by remotely adding to the Absorbatron’s range of broadcast. In this manner, Basil, now calling himself the Controller, took over his entire town, starting with Vincent, who dared to confront his brother. |||| |||| Tony Stark and Janice Cord happened to investigate Cord Industries and Basil took the opportunity to battle Iron Man, who he saw as a product of Stark’s “inferior” genius. Although the Controller seemed to have the upper hand, Iron Man was able to lead him out of range of the Absorbatron and defeat him. |||| |||| While in prison, Basil found that the mental energies he had previously absorbed left him with enough power to take control over others’ minds. Thus, he arranged for his own transfer to a sanitarium and systematically took control over the staff and patients. After using his pawns to create a new Absorbatron for him, he also wanted to upgrade his helmet to avoid his previous defeat. He lured Tony Stark to the santitarium, forcing him to invent a helmet that no longer would allow him to travel out of range but could also fire destructive bolts of mental energy. Tony Stark battled the Controller as Iron Man until the circutis in the Controller’s helmet fried, a design Stark intentionally put in to foil the Controller. |||| |||| Later, somehow he was contacted by Thanos, who provided Sandhurst with alien technology to update and enhance his equipment. Now, Basil no longer needed the Absorbatron as he could absorb his victims’ mental energies directly from their slave discs. He was defeated, however, by Captain Marvel. |||| |||| Sandhurst continued to enslave others by moving to southern California and setting himself up as a New Age guru and attaching slave discs to visitors to his temple. At the time, Iron Man was seeking out any illegeal use of technology stole from Stark Industries, which included the Controller, and Iron Man defeated him, destroying the Controller’s technology and leaving him wholly dependant on his life-support machines. |||| |||| Even still, the Controller continued his criminal activities. The Red Skull partnered with him to manipulate the Sub-Mariner into fighting Captain America, but the Captain destroyed the slave disc that was controlling his friend and the two turned the tables on him. Briefly, the Controller set up a self-help clinic. By placing his “patients” in a device similar to a tanning salon booth, he would profess to cure their minds. In fact, he created the booths to mimic his slave disc technology. Thus, he would “cure” his victims, but not before using his powers to extort money for himself and boost the strength of his armor. He was again defeated by Iron Man who, as Tony Stark, tried to visit the clinic. |||| |||| Another time, the Controller managed to place Sarah Jessup, a powerful psychic, under his control, feeding him more power than ever before and allowing him to control others without the need of his slave discs. He sought out Tony Stark for revenge, but as the two battled, they released a being called Mindstorm, a psychic entity that manifested from Sarah Jessup’s mind. They both had to contend with Mindstorm that resulted in the two enemies sharing each other’s minds for a brief time. Stark was able to destroy the Controller’s machines, but the process left Sarah dead and Basil in a vegetative state with only his machines keeping him alive. |||| |||| The Controller next appeared hoping to capture the alien Legacy (Genis-Vell). He placed Captain Marvel (Monica Rambeau) under his control and sent her to fight Genis. The two were able to combine forces to defeat the Controller. As it happened, the Controller was trying to capture Genis as a test of his technology on behalf of the Master of the World, who had revived him from his coma and appropriated his technology for himself. |||| |||| The Master gave his other agents, the U-Foes, a slave disc to attach to the Hulk. With the Hulk under their control, the U-Foes attacked the United Nations in order to use other discs to drain the knowledge of the scientsits that were assembled there. The U-Foes were opposed by Iron Fist and a new Heroes for Hire team, and they managed to free the Hulk and force the U-Foes to escape, but not before they had got what they came for. The Master then ordered the Controller and the U-Foes to attack the Heroes for Hire, and when the Controller seemed about to be defeated, the U-Foes prepared to teleport away, leaving the Controller to take the fall for the Master’s plan. Instead, the Master double-crossed the villains, and the U-Foes were captured as well. |||| |||| With the Master’s abandonment, the Controller was free to pursue his own agenda. He used his mental dominion to once again escape prison, setting himself up as a doctor, Alexander Basel, of a stress-management clinic. He managed to draw in high-profile clients, including businessmen and senators, and he would use his mind-control technology on them while they slept. Tony Stark attended the clinic, and the Controller saw an opportunity for revenge. He ordered Stark to fire Iron Man, not knowing that the two were one and the same. The conflict Stark felt led him to uncover the Controller’s influence, and he defeated the Controller as Iron Man. |||| |||| More recently, the Controller was among those villains incarcerated in the Raft and escaped during a massive breakout. He tried to set himself up as a crime boss in New York City, competing with many other villains, but he was ultimately captured by the new Avengers."

Faulkner was exhibiting her installation when Dr. Thomas Moyers, a colleague arguing the potential dangers of the project to reporter Lois Lane, shut off the machine's safety systems. The resulting explosion transformed Faulkner into a huge, incredibly strong orange-skinned amazon, and nearly killed Moyers and Lane. |||| |||| Kitty had gained the ability to absorb solar energy through her skin, which made her grow continually taller and stronger. Disoriented and confused, she began to run amok through the streets of Metropolis. The Daily Planet, not knowing she was actually Kitty Faulkner, quickly dubbed her 'Rampage'. Superman stepped in, but showed restraint in subduing her, mistakenly thinking she was Lois Lane. After Rampage was revealed to be Dr. Faulkner, Superman was able to drain off her excess solar energy and return Kitty to normal. |||| |||| Months later Dr. Faulkner fell ill, finding that her body now needed exposure to a certain amount of solar and cosmic energy or she would die. Dr. Moyers gave her a technological device in the form of a collar that would maintain the proper amount of exposure to keep her alive. But Moyers also had a sinister motive, he transformed Faulkner into Rampage and had her sabotage the presidential campaign of Herbert Forrest. Forrest and Moyers were former friends, but Moyers had come to resent the candidate's corrupt morality. After several attacks Superman helped free Rampage from Moyers' control and sent him to jail. After modifying the regulator control collar, Kitty had her powers under control, and accepted a job at S.T.A.R. Labs. |||| |||| Faulkner proved to be a talented administrator and earned a transfer to new S.T.A.R. Labs in Phoenix Arizona. Once there she befriended the young superhero Starman (Will Payton). She helped him on several occasions as Rampage, and the two formed a relationship. Her part-time career of heroics and her romance came to an end when she was sent back to Metropolis to take part in the major reorganization of S.T.A.R. Labs necessitated by the destruction of the corporations' main laboratory. |||| |||| Since her return to Metropolis, it has been hinted that Kitty may have developed a crush on the Parasite (Rudy Jones) before his death."

In short order, Maria became pregnant with Howard's child. During one of her experiments, an infected monkey broke loose from its cage and transmitted a deadly virus to Maria. She was rushed to the hospital, but there was little that could be done.

And direct sunlight.,"She fell in love with Cosmic Boy from her privileged youth on the sunless world of Kathoon.  There, she pestered her scientist father to 'create' a power for her so that she could go to Earth and attempt Legion membership.  That attempt failed, because she didn't realize her powers would only work outside sunlight. |||| |||| As she wandered around Metropolis immediately following her rejection, she encountered a similarly-dejected Polar Boy.  Together, they purposed to create the Legion of Substitute heroes.  In effect, then, she is the 'Saturn Girl of the Subs'—its founding mother. |||| |||| In her subsequent appearances, a dominant theme was her unrequited love for Cosmic Boy.  She was typically put in situations where she could have told Cos how she felt, but didn't. |||| |||| Eventually, though, the two did get together.  One such occasion was the dominant 1960s vision of the Legion's future, in which it was posited that the two had finally married.  However,  in the 1970s, their relationship in their youths was finally depicted, no doubt aided by Night Girl's radical costume re-design."

She is close friends with Mary Jane. In Ultimate Spider-Man #4 (February 2001), a drunk Liz attempts to make out with Peter, who refuses her advances when Mary Jane sees them. They later have a very personal moment when both students are called to talk about The Green Goblin's attack on the school. Otherwise, there is no instance of any relationship between Peter and Liz. Liz had an uncle who was a mutant, and this led to his death, though what exactly happened has not been explained. (The Official Handbook of the Ultimate Marvel Universe suggested that her uncle may have been killed in Magneto's attacks during Ultimate X-Men, but Bendis has never commented on it.) As a result of this, Liz has a phobia of mutants and super-powered beings, and it has been suggested by other characters that she worries that she herself is a mutant. When Johnny Storm joined her school briefly, she became extremely attracted to him and they shared a happy date - until he accidentally lit himself on fire, revealing himself as the Human Torch. Due to her phobia, she refused to see him ever again, and he left the school. |||| |||| With the arrival of Kitty Pryde, a publicly known mutant & former X-Man, at Midtown High, Liz has been complaining to anyone that will listen that Kitty should be with her 'own kind' and even accused Kitty of thinking she was better than everyone else due to her being a former X-Man, at which point Kitty rebutted Liz's accusations. Liz's best friend, Mary Jane, has also told Liz to keep her mutant phobia to herself when she's around MJ, and that she'd prefer it if Liz kept those thoughts to herself in general. |||| |||| Later it was revealed Liz herself is a mutant with flame powers, and also the secret love child of mutant villain the Blob. In order to learn how to control her powers, Liz decided to attend Xavier's school where she now remains."

Nero often volunteered to test the bio-armor's capabilities. Howard Stark lost controlling interest in Stark Defense Corporation to his rival Zebediah Stane, but fortunately, he had no legal ownership over projects designed by Bio-Armor. |||| |||| Frustrated beyond measure, Zebediah Stane was determined to learn the secrets behind Stark's armor coating. He sent some men to track down and abduct Nero, bringing him back to an undisclosed facility. Stane applied one of his own inventions, a mind-reading skullcap called the Lid, to Nero's head. The machine violently ripped all information concerning the bio-armor's designs from Nero's mind, leaving him insensate. Nero survived the experience, but his intellect was reduced to that of a toddler. |||| |||| Stane still had some mental control over Nero however. When he learned that Howard Stark used the bio-armor to save the life of his son Antonio, he tried to mind-control the addle-brained Nero into abducting the child for him. Nero resisted the mental summons long enough to scribble out a warning to Howard Stark. To prevent Stane from gaining complete control over him, Nero killed himself by stabbing himself in the ear with a pencil until it pierced his brain."
