3247,Hellcat (Marvel),Patricia 'Patsy' Walker Hellstrom ,3247_20070104000757_char.jpg,Sensitive to some psychic phenomena. Athelete level physical strength enhanced when wearing her costume.,,"Patricia Walker was the only daughter of Joshua Walker and Dorothy Walker, a comic book writer. While she was still a child her mother acted as her agent, helping her at modeling and commercial work. Dorothy Walker’s greatest success was the creation of a comic book named after her young daughter, featuring romantic adventures of Patsy and her real-life friends as teenagers. The Patsy Walker comic book was very popular and continued for over a decade as Patsy grew into and out of her teens. Patsy Walker felt very strange about her mother’s fictionalized exploitation of her, and was relieved when the series ceased publication. Constantly exposed to comic books, Walker grew up to idolize the heroes her mother’s colleagues wrote about. However, she ceased daydreaming soon after high school and married her childhood friend, Robert Baxter (who had appeared in the Patsy Walker comic as her romantic interest.) Baxter was in the officers training program of the Air Force, and Walker spent the next several years of her life on a number of Air Force bases. |||| |||| |||| While her husband was assigned to a security post at the heavily government-subsidized Brand Corporation in New Jersey, Patsy Walker met the Beast and learned his secret identity. Walker had long idolized 'super heroes', and she elicited the promise from him that in exchange for keeping his secret, he would help her become a 'super heroine'. Walker’s marriage eventually came to a bitter end, and she sought out the Beast, who was now a member of the Avengers, to remind him of his promise. Tagging along with the Avengers to investigate criminal activities at the Brand Corporation, Walker discovered a costume like that worn by Greer Nelson in her identity as the Cat. Putting the costume on, Walker dubbed herself Hellcat and used her natural athletic abilities to help the Avengers. Walker believed that the costume had somehow enhanced her agility and speed, and by the power of suggestion more than anything else, it had. |||| |||| |||| Although she hoped to join the Avengers, Hellcat was persuaded by the Titanian priestess Moondragon to accompany her to Titan to undergo a period of training. During her stay on Titan, Hellcat’s minor psionic potential was artificially enhanced by various electronic organic devices (Moondragon used similar technology to give powers to Angar the Screamer and Ramrod) and was given extensive martial arts training. Upon her return to Earth, she met the Defenders and decided to accept their offer of membership rather than the Avengers. Hellcat remained a core member of the loosely organized Defenders for several years, becoming particularly close to the Valkyrie and Nighthawk. Eventually she met Damion Hellstrom, who in his costumed guise of the Son of Satan, joined the Defenders for a short time, and after he was cured of his demonic aspect found that she was in love with him. Renouncing her costumed identity, Patsy Walker decided to marry Hellstrom. The couple was married in Greentown, Ohio, where her father currently resided. The wedding, attended by several of her Defenders colleagues, was interrupted by her ex-husband 'Buzz' Baxter, who had assumed the costumed guise of Mad Dog, and the Mutant Force. The Defenders repulsed the attack and Hellstrom subdued Mad-Dog. The Hellstroms then moved to San Francisco where they established themselves as occult investigators. In this capacity, they helped several superheroes in mystical problems, notably the Avengers' West Coast branch. In helping the Avengers, Pasty again donned the Hellcat costume and remained on hand to help them capture the villains Tiger Shark and Whirlwind. |||| |||| |||| Sometime later, however, Hellstrom's dark soul reasserted itself and Patsy was driven mad at the sight of it. She languished in a near-vegetable state for months afterward until the mercy-killing entity Deathurge sensed her despair and, at her request, freed her spirit from her body, effectively killing herself. She soon after contacted Earth from a spirit plane and announced her intention via radio to return in the near future. |||| |||| |||| Patsy had ended up in the realm of the demon Mephisto, fighting an eternal battle in the so-called Arena of Tainted Souls, alongside fallen Avenger Mockingbird. Months later, the Avenger villain Grim Reaper resurrected Patsy and Mockingbird, among others, tainting them with his hatred for the Avengers and setting them against the team. With the help of the Scarlet Witch, Patsy and the others reverted to their true personalities and aided the Avengers against the Grim Reaper before returning from whence they came. Before she disappeared, Mockingbird was able to send a warning to her husband Hawkeye about a plan Hellstrom was developing. Hawkeye and his team the Thunderbolts confronted Hellstrom and then used their sorcerous connections to go to Hell in order to restore Mockingbird. They were tricked however, by Hellstrom, and the Thunderbolts rescued Patsy instead, restoring her bodily to Earth. |||| |||| |||| Pasty remained despondent and depressed due to her perceived failures in life and time spent in Hell. She nevertheless presented a good front, wrote an autobiography and began a book tour. Shortly thereafter, Patsy returned to Centerville to find her high school rival Hedy had joined with the corporation that was built upon the Patsy comics fortune and turned Centerville into a tourist attraction. Patsy discovered the town was also infiltrated with demonic forces, led by the evil warlock Nicholas Scratch. Scratch had allowed a cult called the Sons of the Serpents to use the citizens of Centerville for their occult purposes, and altering the Avengers, Patsy resumed her Hellcat identity and defeated the Serpents alongside her team. |||| |||| |||| Patsy was still despondent about life when later Scratch's minions attacked Hellcat. She then uncovered a plot by the extradimensional villain Dormammu to take over the various dimensions of Hell, each led by different demons, among them Mephisto, Hellstrom, and Satannish. Hellcat helped Mephisto thwart Dormammu by uniting the demons along with the death gods Pluto and Hela. She also revealed Hellstrom's father was actually Satannish, a pawn of Dormammu. Ultimately, she escaped back to Earth by proving to Mephisto that he would be better served to have her on Earth. Revitalized by her adventure, Pasty rededicated her life to super heroics as Hellcat. |||| |||| |||| One day, Patsy's supernaturally-tinged senses brought her to the attention of a homeless man. She tried to recuperate him, and he turned out to be the Defenders' villain Yandroth the Magician, who began systematically attacking Earth by binding the spirit of Mother Earth itself. Patsy escaped and managed to contact the various members of the Defenders to stop him, re-forming the team after a long hiatus. As a result of the battle, several of the Defenders were cursed to continually band together, and Patsy and the remaining Defenders elected to stay together as a team to support them."

He has a superhumanly strong and durable physique and ages far more slowly than most humanoids. His chief power is to stimulate the pleasure centers in the brains of others. Eros can surround himself with a personal force field so that he can travel through space and underwater, and can both fly and perform telekinetic stunts using his ability to harness gravitons.",,"750,000 years ago, Alars, a member of the Eternals of Earth, a cosmic-powered sub-species of humanity, departed Earth after his brother Zuras became the Eternals' leader. Alars journeyed to Titan, a moon of Saturn, where a band of exiled Eternal settlers had slaughtered each other in war. Alars married the only survivor, a young woman named Sui-San, and they transformed Titan into a paradise. Alars ruled the Eternals of Titan as Mentor and created ISAAC, a computer which serviced all of Titan's technological needs. |||| |||| The youngest son of Mentor and Sui-San, Eros had the natural ability to excite pleasure in others, but his power had no effect upon his mutant older brother, Thanos, who worshiped the cosmic embodiment of Death and led an army against Titan. During this assault, Thanos killed and dissected Sui-San, trying to learn why he was born different. While his brother was captivated by Death, Eros loved life, and began visiting other systems for adventure and romance. Eros even visited Earth at least once, and was remembered in Earth's legends. He had many lovers, but his only steady relationship was with the prostitute Heater Delight. Eros later helped Heater escape more than one possessive master, including Dark Roger and Axel the Rescorlan. While she was the property of Pro-Boscis the Procurer, Heater kept Eros from saving her because she didn't want his face damaged; she instead manipulated Pip the Troll into saving her. |||| |||| In recent times, Thanos conquered Titan with another army, slaughtering most of the Titans until Mentor and Eros were the only remaining resistance. Thanos, now seeking the Cosmic Cube, brought Rick Jones to Titan to learn its location. Rick was freed by Mentor, Eros and the Kree warrior Captain Marvel, who had been bonded to Rick; together, they battled Thanos' armies and drove off his lieutenant on Titan, the Super-Skrull. Mar-Vell ultimately bested Thanos by seemingly destroying the Cosmic Cube, and Mentor and Eros were able to rebuild Titan. Mar-Vell became a close friend of the Titans after his help. |||| |||| Thanos, however, had secretly left behind a programming virus compelling ISAAC to act on his behalf. Creating lieutenants for itself, ISAAC took the Titans captive. One lieutenant, Elysius, was attracted to Eros, but she later shifted her affections to Mar-Vell and changed sides when he came to Titan to oppose ISAAC. Mar-Vell ultimately drove Thanos' programming from ISAAC, saving Titan. Mar-Vell soon succumbed to cancer, spending his last days on Titan. Eros was devastated by the loss, and remained close to Elysius in the days that followed. Elysius eventually had ISAAC help her create a son from Mar-Vell's DNA; she named the child Genis. He was raised to believe that Eros was his father, and Eros helped maintain the facade until Genis' accelerated coming of age. |||| |||| Longing for new adventures, Eros visited Earth again and encountered the Avengers battling the Plantman. Eros asked to join their team and was accepted as an Avenger-in-training; but the Avengers were reluctant to present a man named 'Eros' to the public so the Wasp rechristened him 'Starfox.' Eros was chagrined to meet fellow trainee Captain Marvel (Monica Rambeau), and he looked down on her, still stung by the death of Mar-Vell. Starfox learned teamwork and responsibility amongst the Avengers, but still found time to engage in several romantic liaisons, including a one-night stand with his teammate She-Hulk. The team also valued Starfox for his scientific knowledge as he was serving on a roster devoid of the Avengers' usual scientific geniuses. After many of the Avengers were taken to Battleworld to serve in the Beyonder's 'Secret Wars,' the Vision became the Avengers' chairman and promoted Starfox to full membership to fill out the roster. Starfox retained his standing when the other Avengers returned. |||| |||| One evening, Starfox invited himself and the Wasp to a party in Soho which was held by Sersi, a member of Earth's Eternals. When Sersi was brought to the Eternals' city of Olympia to participate in a gathering of all Eternals, Starfox was brought along. In Olympia, he fascinated his Earth-bound cousins with the story of how Alars had founded Titan. Starfox participated in the Eternals' Ritual of the Uni-Mind, merging with them into a single psionic entity; but when the villain Maelstrom tried to siphon the Uni-Mind's power for himself, and the Vision and Scarlet Witch freed the Eternals from the Uni-Mind. Starfox managed to incapacitate Maelstrom with his pleasure powers, which he revealed to the Avengers for the first time. Maelstrom caused his own death by having his servant Deathurge kill him so that he could live anew in another cloned body. The Avengers subsequently thwarted Maelstrom's next plot to halt the Earth's rotation. After seeing Captain Marvel's courage in that battle, Starfox finally accepted her use of his friend's name, apologizing to her for the way he had slighted her. |||| |||| The Avengers became embroiled in a civil war amongst the Skrulls, during which the pirate Nebula seized Thanos' star-ship Sanctuary II and used it to command a Skrullian fleet to destroy the planet Xandar. When Starfox confronted Nebula, she claimed that Thanos was her grandfather. Before Eros could learn more, Nebula was teleported away by the Beyonder, who had misunderstood the wish of the Xandarian survivor Firelord that Nebula be cast out of the galaxy. Starfox was determined to learn if Nebula's story was true, quit the Avengers to hunt her alongside Firelord. The pair were attacked by Super-Nova, another survivor of Xandar who incorrectly believed Nebula to be one of the Avengers, and Starfox was badly injured, but he soon recuperated and resumed his pursuit of Nebula. He finally caught up to her and helped the Avengers thwart her attempt to harness the Infinity Union, a device of the Stranger's which could grant her cosmic power. |||| |||| Soon afterward, Thanos obtained the Infinity Gauntlet (which housed the six Infinity Gems) and used it to offer the universe to Death. Thanos took Starfox hostage during the crisis so that his brother could witness his actions, but Thanos allowed himself to be beaten, not truly desiring victory in the end. Starfox continued to serve as an occasional Avenger, participating in the Avengers' mission to the Shi'ar Empire during the Kree-Shi'ar war, as well as joining the Avengers against Morgan Le Fay when she mastered the power of the Twilight Sword. |||| |||| In the aftermath of that battle, Starfox befriended his fellow Avenger Tigra, and she set off into space with him to visit Deneb-VII. Tigra soon became bored of Deneb-VII, but the duo found new excitement when the universe was threatened by the Infinites, cosmic beings from another universe who had no regard for the lives of lesser beings. Starfox and Tigra teamed with Jack of Hearts, Quasar, Thor, Photon and Moondragon to face the Infinites. Starfox helped appeal to the Infinites through Eternity, the embodiment of space, and one of the Infinites ultimately chose to sacrifice itself to repair some of the damage they had done. Later, Starfox led a small army of Eternals in attacking Thanos (or possibly one of the 'clones' known as the Thanosi) during his quest for the Celestial Messiah, but they were soundly defeated and Eros was cast into outer space, beaten senseless. |||| |||| Starfox later confronted the time-traveler Thanatos, a version of Rick Jones from another reality intent on gathering items of power. Thanatos struck Starfox in the neck with the Spear of Destiny, causing a wound which could not be healed, then threatened to kill him unless he brought Rick Jones (now bonded to Genis) to him. Starfox was forced to comply, but Rick and Genis were able to defeat Thanatos in the end, reversing his actions. After Genis' power of cosmic awareness drove him insane, Starfox joined with Elysius, Mentor and the other Titans in opposing him; they were ultimately able to help Genis regain his sanity."

The boy was severely autistic, and as a result was subjected to various experimental treatments. One of these treatments seemd to bring the boy to a normal level of cognizance, but also brought out a streak of rage and violence. |||| |||| The boy saw images of Aquaman on television, and was drawn to the sight of a man completely submerged in his beloved water. As an adult, the orphan designed a costume (primarily a black wetsuit with bug-eyed helmet) and fashioned a high-tech submersible inspired by black manta fish. Taking the name Black Manta, he and his masked army became a force to be reckoned with, engaging in several as-yet-unrecorded clashes with Aquaman before joining the short-lived Injustice League and later Orm the Ocean Master. |||| |||| Manta and Aquaman battled repeatedly over the next several years, until the day Manta killed Arthur III, Aquaman's son. Prior to Arthur III's death, it was revealed that Black Manta was actually an African-American man (and that this is why he called himself Black Manta), whose objective was for the Black people to be dominant in the ocean after having been oppressed for so long on dry land. Most of Black Manta's henchmen were also black. |||| |||| Black Manta later sold his soul to the demon Neron in exchange for more power, and transformed into a Manta/Man hybrid. He took to wearing a new costume that completely covered his appearance, and inexplicably stopped tormenting Aquaman and instead indulged in drug smuggling from his new base in Star City. Here, he was opposed by Green Arrow and Aquaman. |||| |||| In a later confrontation, Aquaman, sporting the Lady of the Lake's Healing Hand, reversed Neron's alterations to Black Manta, and rewired Manta's afflicted brain, making him normal for the first time in his life.

Mentor is also able to calculate the weakest point in a structural formation or a living being. With his opponents, this ability allows Mentor to defeat them speedily and with little wasted exertion.",,"Mentor is a member of the Imperial Guard, a multi-ethnic group of super-powered alien beings who act as enforcers of the laws of the Shi'ar Empire. Part of the division of the Imperial Guard known as the Superguardians, the super-intelligent Mentor was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix Lilandra from her insane brother, then-Majestor D'ken. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor. |||| |||| Mentor was later among those few Imperial Guard members who opposed the treacherous Shi'ar High Council member Lord Samédàr who was aiding an attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by Deathbird. Even after many of the Guard chose to side with Samédàr, Mentor remained steadfast in his loyalty to then-Empress Lilandra. |||| |||| When the Empress Lilandra, having regained her throne, learned of the many Earth heroes that had sacrificed their lives to stop the malevolent psionic being named Onslaught, she dispatched eight members of the Imperial Guard, including Mentor, to protect Earth. While on Earth, the Guard uncovered a plot by a militant Kree faction to simulate a radical political activist group in revenge for Earth's involvement in the Kree/Shi'ar war. In reality, the group created a 'nega-reactor', similar to the bomb that was used on the Kree. However, this plot was stopped by the Guard, but not before the reactor was used by the Kree's leader, the Supreme Intelligence, to re-incorporate itself after being presumably killed at the end of the war. |||| |||| Subsequently, Mentor was amongst those Imperial Guard members who defended Lilandra against an assassination attempt by the Kree Ronan the Accuser and his unwilling agents, the royal family of the Earth race known as the Inhumans. ||||"
935,Prometheus (DC) (02 - JLA Villain),,935_20050925142432_char.jpg,"Although he possesses no 'superpowers' in the technical sense of the term, Prometheus is incredibly intelligent, and has invented a variety of pieces of technology far more advanced than anything existing in reality. |||| |||| The most prominent device in his arsenal is his helmet, which contains a sophisticated computer wired directly into his central nervous system. This allows him to download any information -- from blueprints to files to another person's mannerisms to the fighting prowess of the world's 30 greatest martial artists -- directly into his brain. |||| |||| Other devices in his arsenal include a tonfa (dubbed 'the nightstick'), which contains an onboard computer of its own and which can generate an energy field allowing it to split anvils with a tap, and his gauntlets, which allow him to fire a variety of projectiles, from mundane bullets to darts containing any number of exotic chemicals. |||| |||| Prometheus also possesses the Cosmic Key, a device of alien origin which allows him to teleport to the interdimensional void known as the Phantom Zone (which he refers to as 'the Ghost Zone'). The Key also allows him to teleport others to the Ghost Zone against their will, and was once seen to disintegrate a man.","Prometheus' helmet, which provides him with his superior fighting skills and also serves as a repository of data on every superhero on the planet, is wired directly into his brain and nervous system. This leaves him vulnerable to attacks which tamper with the helmet. On at least two occasions, this has left him either partially or totally incapacitated.","Prometheus (his true name has never been revealed) was the only child of a pair of ruthless bank robbers and killers, and grew up accompanying them on their crime sprees. After one such spree, the two were cornered by police and chose to commit suicide by cop, dying before their son's eyes. Vowing to destroy 'the forces of justice,' he left home at 16, using both his parents' hidden stashes of money and the proceeds of a blackmail scheme targeting a local crime boss to finance his travels. Under a series of false identities, he studied at prestigious universities, trained as a pitfighter in Brazil, studied silat in Malaysia, joined a terrorist group in the Middle East, and worked as a mercenary in Africa. |||| |||| Eventually, he made his way to Tibet, where he discovered the mythical hidden city of Shambhala. There, he studied with a group of monks who worshiped evil, and eventually was taken into the bowels of the temple by their lama, where he learned the truth: the temple had been constructed atop a crashed alien spaceship many centuries before, and the monks were actually the aliens who had occupied it. Slaying the lama, he escaped Shambhala with the Cosmic Key, which allowed him to transport himself and others into an extra-dimensional realm he dubbed the 'Ghost Zone.' There, he made his base and began designing his costume and other weapons. After returning to America and slaying the police officers who had killed his parents, he decided he was ready to begin his crusade to destroy 'justice.' Although he had at first planned to blow up the Supreme Court, he instead decided to kill the Justice League. |||| |||| The newly-minted Prometheus' first opportunity came when the JLA, as a publicity stunt, created a contest to become 'hero for a day,' which was won by a naive young man called Retro. Slaying him, Prometheus used his helmet to download all of Retro's knowledge and mannerisms into his own head, using it to take his place and sneak aboard the JLA Watchtower on the Moon alongside a group of reporters. Once aboard the Watchtower, he put his plan into action. Using a computer virus programmed into his tonfa, he took control of Steel's armor, ordering it to walk to the far end of the base and then throw his hammer, which would breach the tower's walls. Next, he commandeered the Watchtower's computer, downloading its blueprints into his helmet and tampering with the air supply to increase the oxygen content. Confronted by the Martian Manhunter, he first shot him with a phosphorous dart to weaken him, then shot him with a second dart containing a 'molecular toxin,' which induced 'spastic paralysis' in the shapeshifter and left him a puddle of goo. After stopping to set the forest used to create the tower's air supply on fire, he used the Cosmic Key to teleport the angel Zauriel to the Ghost Zone and used a series of strobing lights on his helmet and his own voice to hypnotize the Huntress. Finally, he used the enhanced combat skills provided by his helmet to best Batman in hand-to-hand combat, poisoned Green Lantern with a 'neural chaff' that prevented him from using his ring, told the Flash that he had installed bombs throughout the base that would be triggered if he used his super-speed, then shot both Green Lantern and the Flash, non-fatally wounding them. |||| |||| Confronting Superman (who, at the time, was in his 'Superman Blue' phase and used electricity-based powers which rendered him effectively invulnerable) outside the shuttle bays, he informed him that he had sabotaged the shuttles, and would only allow the civilians to leave the tower alive if Superman committed suicide. If he refused, Steel's hammer would breach the tower's walls and kill everyone except Superman. This part of his plan was foiled, however, by Plastic Man, who had found Steel and absorbed the impact of his hammer before it could cause any damage. This proved to be Prometheus' downfall. The antihero Catwoman, who had snuck aboard the tower disguised as a reporter, distracted him by cracking her whip into his groin. While he was incapacitated, Steel, who had regained control of his armor, hacked into Prometheus' armor and disabled his helmet. Realizing he was beaten, Prometheus used the Cosmic Key to escape, pausing only to admit that he had been lying to the Flash about the bombs and return Zauriel to his place of origin. |||| |||| Over the next several months, he took to exploring the Ghost Zone, and soon discovered that he was not alone there: also present was a spaceship, used by the White Martians who had threatened the world at the time of the JLA's most recent reorganization, which was itself connected to the Watchtower. Realizing that this gave him a secret backdoor into the JLA's base, Prometheus contacted the billionaire supervillain Lex Luthor, and together the two became the nucleus for a revitalized Injustice Gang. Also invited to join were the alien Queen Bee and General Wade Eiling, now ensconsced in the invulnerable android body of the Shaggy Man. Unbeknownst to any of them, however, their minds were no longer their own. They had actually become the pawns of the sentient superweapon Mageddon, which hoped to use them to help spark the end of the world. Over the course of several weeks, they weakened and distracted the JLA by fomenting conflict all over the world, touched-off a supervillain riot at Belle Reve Penitentiary as a diversion to steal and sabotage the Green Lantern's ring, and planted bombs throughout the Watchtower. Once the Queen Bee's space fleet had assembled in the asteroid belt, the team put their plan into action. |||| |||| Prometheus' assignment was to disrupt the team's technological link, which was coordinated by Oracle from her base in the Gotham clocktower, and download all the team's secrets into his helmet. Infiltrating Oracle's base via the Watchtower, Prometheus offered her a deal: in exchange for willingly going along with the Gang's plans, he would use the same techniques that allowed his helmet to interface with his nervous system and improve his physical prowess to fix her paralysis and allow her to walk again. When she refused, he engaged her in a supremely brief fight, tossing her straight through the face of the clocktower (she survived by hanging onto a hand), although not before she managed to lightly damage his helmet. Disabling the League's communications, he returned to the Watchtower, where he switched out his damaged helmet for the slightly outdated model he'd left behind during his first appearance, and made short work of the Huntress. Confronting Batman in single combat once again, he quickly gained the upper hand. This time, however, Batman played his trump card: he had studied and dissected the outdated helmet Prometheus was wearing, and had cracked its secrets. He then proceeded to overwrite the program Prometheus was using to power his martial arts skills, replacing them with the physical characteristics of Dr. Stephen Hawking, the eminent physicist afflicted with Lou Gehrig's disease, leaving him completely paralyzed. |||| |||| Although this confrontation resulted in Prometheus' capture, he resurfaced again a few months later, with no explanation as to his escape. Unbeknownst to anyone outside the JLA, however, this Prometheus was not the genuine article at all. He was, in fact, Chad Graham, the psychopathic son of one of the policemen who had killed Prometheus' parents. After murdering his own parents before Prometheus could get to them, Graham had been taken under the villain's wing and trained in the hopes that he would become a sidekick to him, much as Robin is to Batman. With the real Prometheus disabled and left in a catatonic state by the telepathic powers of the Martian Manhunter, Graham adopted his costume and weapons and began working under his name. This faux Prometheus, over the course of several real-life years, served as bodyguard to the Batman villain Hush, was press-ganged into the Secret Society of Super-Villains, battled Captain America as part of an inter-company crossover, and was mind-controlled by Starro the Conqueror. Through it all, he proved himself unable to live up to the standards set by the actual Prometheus, and by the end of his run had been defeated in hand-to-hand combat by both the Huntress and Robin. |||| |||| Recently, with the death of the Martian Manhunter, the true Prometheus has reawakened. Escaping from the mental institution where he had been housed, he tracked down Graham and found him being pursued by the members of the superhero team Blood Pack. Casually slaying one member of the Pack and crippling another, he abducted Graham to his base in the Ghost Zone. Outraged at the damage done to his reputation by Graham's performance, he lit him on fire. As his former sidekick burned, Prometheus vowed to soon reclaim his rightful place as a figure of fear and respect, both in the underworld and without."

344,Chronos (DC)(01 - David Clinton),David Clinton ,344_20051031024144_char.jpg,,,"Considered by some to be the arch-nemesis of the Atom (Ray Palmer), Chronos started his career as petty thief David Clinton who attributed his consistent incarceration to his timing, or lack there of. To improve his timing he studied the rhythm of time pieces and by practice he learned to synchronize each of his actions with the beat of the prison clock. By the end of his sentence he had developed an extraordinary sense of timing which he resolved to use to further his criminal career. He then adopted the colorful costume and alter ego of Chronos, the Time Thief. Clinton had acquired an unhealthy fascination with time and he developed a series of gimmick weapons and deathtraps based on time pieces (clocks with blades as hands, flying sun dials). |||| Chronos made his debut in Ivy Town, but was defeated by the Atom. He next tried to steal a collection of historic Hungarian clocks, but was again defeated. The Atom has since thwarted all of Chronos plans. Each appearance or new crime prompted an evolution in Chronos's weaponry. His study of time led to more intricate and revolutionary inventions -- lenses that prevent people from seeing certain events (e.g. his getaway vehicle or another specific object), circuitry embedded in his costume that could control the local flow of time (freezing people in time or altering his own perception of time), and ultimately a fully functional time machine (before it and the designs were destroyed). One story suggested that Chronos may have been receiving help from a future version of himself, but it is unknown at what relative time frame that Chronos came from. |||| Chronos eventually stopped stealing for his own gain and began stealing to finance his time research. The Atom had always thwarted Chronos, but he had decided to turn his back on humanity and had retreated to a peaceful seclusion with a group a six-inch tall aliens in the Amazonian jungle. Chronos had more success without the Atom, but he brought himself to the attention of the Blue Beetle (Ted Kord) when he tried to blackmail one of the employees of Kord Inc. He also fought the Beetle during Darkseid's anti-hero riots. During one struggle against the Beetle, Chronos was hurled 100 million years into the past where he encountered a time-lost Captain Atom. |||| Upon his return to the present Chronos was able to use his technology to manipulate the money markets to amass a fortune, but old habits die hard, and Chronos's illegal endeavors were discovered and he was returned to prison. He was freed by the Calendar Man to work with the Time Foes, but was captured by the Team Titans. Out of desperation and humiliation, Chronos took a drastic chance -- he accepted an offer from the demon Neron and exchanged his soul for the metahuman ability to travel through time. However bargains with Neron are never fair and Chronos found that each journey through the timestream accelerated his ageing. A man who should have been a healthy adult became an aged senior citizen. |||| All the experiments and Neron's 'gift' had taken a toll on Clinton's body and be began to loose touch with any sense of the 'now.' He had trouble staying localized in time and appeared to fade away into nothingness. His disappearance was enough for him to be declared dead and speculation has suggested that he may have slipped into 'The Void' of time. A funeral of sorts was held and his research was passed on to the second Chronos (Walker Gabriel). This entry uses material derived in whole or in part from wikipedia.org ."

They are near ageless, immune to all diseases and have superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and a high level of resistance to injury. Volstagg possesses the conventional superhuman abilities of an Asgardian male. |||| |||| Volstagg is superhumanly strong, his strength being somewhat greater than that of the average Asgardian. Volstagg is also extremely long lived, though not immortal, and ages at a pace much slower than humans. The tissues of his body are also more resilient than those of a human, rendering him much more resistant to physical injury. If he is injured, his body is able to heal itself with superhuman speed and efficiency. Volstagg's superior musculature and metabolism grants him superhuman levels of stamina. Like all Asgardians, Volstagg's bone, skin and muscle are much denser than that of a human, which helps to contribute to his superhuman strength and durability. |||| |||| Volstagg is an excellent overall battlefield warrior, a superb hand-to-hand combatant and horseman. He is also sometimes armed with a sword. He has also demonstrated skill in the area of battlefield medicine and healing arts, though he makes no claim of being a healer of any real proficiency. He has also used the Elixir of Recovery, an Asgardian medical potion. |||| |||| Volstagg also is known to have a specialized weapon, the Brandrheid Undrsigr, also known as the Bright Blade of Wondrous Victory.",,"Volstagg is an Asgardian and the large, jovial member of the Warriors Three. Seemingly much older than other Asgardians, Volstagg will often be the cause of more problems than the solution. He likes food and drink and is very boastful. Despite his flaws, Volstagg is a trusted member of the Warriors Three and a trusted ally to Thor. Volstagg has a large family and an unknown number of children with his wife, Gudrun. The most well known of these is Hildy. Originally Voltsagg was a slimmer and more athletic man, in his days before meeting his future cohorts and best friends Fandral and Hogun. Volstagg was known and celebrated as a mighty warrior and adventurer. He would exclaim that a dead frost giant a day, by his hand, was required to cater to his battle lust. An encounter with a younger, brasher Fandral however resulted in a bet, a challenge in which both warriors would try to prove who was the greater and braver adventurer. A much quieter and shier Hogun would be the judge and impartial observer. The challenge? To pet the monstrous creature wolf creature Fenris on his head. However the journey itself to the bounded and mighty Fenris itself was tasked and fraught with adversity. Adversity that brought the three men to friendship and loyalty, and by the time Volstagg, Fandral and Hogun reached their destination they were bonded in friendship. |||| |||| An incident and a pact would happen subsequently, one that would supposedly affect Volstagg's psyche to such an extent he would let his muscular physique fall to appetite, however this is somewhat ambiguous theory. Years later after his own adventures both apart and with the Warriors Three after an order by Odin himself calling forward for Asgard's greatest warriors, Volstagg and his co Warriors Three reunited and have been a constant defender of both Asgard and their inhabitants and allies, including Thor, Sif and Balder. |||| |||| *** THE WARRIORS THREE *** |||| A much younger and slimmer albeit still large and physically imposing Volstagg ends up having a quarrel with the young and show boating warrior Fandral. Hogun, a meek and quiet young man is witness to their banter and taunts. The task the two more confident warriors put forward to each other, is to venture forth into dangerous territories to find the menacing Fenris Wolf and to pat it on the head. The first of either Volstagg or Fandral to achieve this, will be considered the victor of the dispute that had just arisen! After days of travel, the three warriors facing arduous challenges, one after the other, they reach the menacing Fenris Wolf. Chained still, but still an impressively fearful sight. Though at this stage, after much travel and bounding, Volstagg and Fandral and Hogun are more brothers endeared than rivals with arrogant attitudes towards each other. No long is this a quest of individual pursuits but a challenge for a team. Unfortunately the young trio have underestimated the Wolf Fenris. The beast forces the young trio into a pact, to be paid at a later date. This pact was necessary but weighed in on the three Asgardians conscious. |||| |||| In modern day era, and times, Volstagg has tasked himself a challenge at a Bronxton Food Diner with an All You Can Eat Challenge (rather menu) failing to realize that the All You Can Eat meal wasn't an actual challenge, much to the horror of the establishments owner. However once the Gjallarhorn of Heimdall sounded, Volstagg was quick to join his close companions for the emergency that the horn's blow meant. The emergency warranting their attention, was that Fenris had escaped. With their history with the beast, the Warriors Three set about trying to capture him. Volstagg along with Fandral and Hogun discover that Earth corporation AIM is involved and worse still, trolls, Rock Trolls, bar their path led by the dangerous Ulik. With Fandral injured its Volstagg that is instrumental in defeating the trolls. Further on in their quest to apprehend Fenris they encounter a AIM employee, however they are quick to realize she is not normal human - she has been infused with Fenris' blood, providing her augmented strength (enough to lift and throw Volstagg himself), speed and durability. After a small skirmish they learn her name, Helen Gable and they realize she is an ally. The Asagrdians learning that AIM has been weaponizing Fenris and more than that, the deal they struck with him, had resulted in Fenris being able to shape shift into a mortal guise. A most unsettling development. Worse still, he planned on taking a power Ragnarok bomb to the heart of Asgard where he would destroy it, and destroy himself as well. With their new ally the Asgardian warriors are able to trick Fenris defeating him and preventing him from succeeding in his attack against Asgard. Volstagg had a pivotal role in the plan, as it was he who had the strength to lift the giant Ragnarok bomb and carry it away from Fenris, the Ragnarok bomb significantly larger in size than Volstagg."

This misdeed was quickly discovered when Sif awoke and Thor forced Loki to restore her hair. Loki attempted to create a bargain with the trolls Brokk and Eitri, who made the hair out of pure gold. Unfortunately, Loki stole the newly created hair before it was able to be treated with a special potion and upon placing the hair on Sif's head, it grew darker by the minute before finally turning as black as night. Sif continued to grieve over the loss of her golden hair until her parents finally tired of her vanity and sent her to learn the way of the warriors by having her train to become a shield maiden. |||| |||| During her time in training, Sif still accompanied Thor and Loki on adventures, although she never forgave Loki for his cruel prank. Sif often attempted to get romantically closer to Thor and even developed a brief rivalry with Amora the Enchantress and Brunhilde, the future Valkyrie, when she was tricked by the former and Loki into stealing the Mirror of Mycha from Karnilla's palace. Amora and Loki both told Sif that she would be able to use the mirror to permanently capture Thor's affections, but Amora used the mirror on Thor before Sif had the opportunity. Brunhilde eventually came to Sif's aid when the two put aside their differences to work together and release Thor from the mirror's enchantment. Although Thor was disappointed in Sif's initial attempts to use the mirror, the two quickly made up and rekindled their budding relationship. |||| |||| *** CREATION *** |||| Sif is a Marvel comics character based on and inspired by the mythological Norse goddess of the same name, Marvels Sif was adapted/created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby and first appeared in Journey into Mystery #102 which was released in 1964. A supporting character of Thor's stories in Journey into Mystery Sif would naturally continue this supporting role when the title would change to simply Thor two years later in 1966. Sif would make regular appearances in this title as a valued warrior of Asgard, and also a romantic context with Thor but eventually Sif would also be starring in her own plots and story-lines. In 2012, Sif would undertake a significant new chapter and for the first time would be the starring and leading protagonist of a book in Journey Into Mystery written by Kathryn Immonen. Speaking of the character she would write 'Sif's got her origin story, but beyond that she's really kind of a blank slate aside from the broad strokes of her personality,' Immonen says. 'It's thrilling that the real estate has been put aside to develop her character in a way that hasn't really been done before.'The mythological Sif is first attested to in the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda from the 13th century. Sif is also associated with the earth, hunting, harvest and fertility. |||| |||| *** SILVER AGE *** |||| Sif first appeared in the Thor title as it was written under Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. With some fifty issues of Thor already under their collective belt, the two creators had already had and introduced a variety of supporting characters for the titles main protagonist the mighty Thor, including the books main romantic interest for the protagonist Jane Foster. They would introduce Sif in the modern area (Sif's first appearance in Journey Into Mystery #102 was a flashback) with a storyline wherein Jane Foster would travel to Asgard with Thor, Thor hoping that she would met Odins approval and be transformed into a god so the two could marry. Jane would fail Odins test also earning failing to impress the all father. Sif would be introduced in this arc to essentially add another potential romantic interest for Thor as well as add another Asgardian supporting character as well as one adapted from the real world Norse mythology like Thor. Sif would enter the scene with the Thor character heartbroken after losing Jane Foster. Sif would be introduced as an immortal and warrior to contrast against Fosters mortality and all to human fragility. Aiding Thor in battle against the Lurking Unknown would spark new hope, romance and enthusiasm in the thunder god, and would also mark the beginning of Sif's role in the Marvel Universe. After Jane Foster failed Odin's tests to win Thor's love, Sif was introduced, and she joined Thor on many adventures as a fellow warrior. |||| |||| *** SON OF ASGARD *** |||| In her early years a young Sif would often spend time with Thor and Balder, adventuring, training, fighting and laughing. One particular source of amusement for young Sif would be watching Thor fruitlessly struggling to lift the mighty enchanted uru hammer Mjolnir. She would still empathize with the son of Odin when he failed to lift it, pointing out that he may still wield the weapon in the future and that she laughs at his inability to give up. The three would discuss Mjolnir and Sif would point out how she didn't like how the inscription on Mjolnir specified the male gender when she might be just as worthy to lift it one day. Balder and Thor would agree with her idea, possibly not wishing to incur Sif's wrath. Loki overhearing the three would be annoyed by Sif's negativity towards him and so set about using magics to increase the size of three common spiders causing them to grow incredibly massive. Sif, Balder and Thor would grab more common weapons and slay the massive spiders much to Odin's pride as he would enter the room as the three teens would finish their battle. Acknowledging their teamwork and battle prowess Odin would reward the trio with a challenge, a quest and an adventure. Odin has set the objective for Sif, Balder and Thor to gather magical and rare materials that Odin shall forge into a legendary sword that shall be gifted upon a deserving Asgardian warrior. They trio are to gather a scale from the dragon Hakurei from the land of Nastrand. To acquire a feather from the massive snow eagle Gnori, residing in Jotunheim, a precious jewel from Jennia, and a vial of water from Lake Lilitha in Lilitha."

Intellectually advanced, he studied both science and the secrets of his mother's witchcraft early in life, and came to the United States on a scholarship to Empire State University. |||| |||| At school, von Doom became acquainted with both Reed Richards and Ben Grimm, later of the Fantastic Four.  His studies focussed on trans-dimensional communication and travel, fixated especially on methods of communicating with his dead mother.  Due to his feelings of insecurity at Reed Richard's scientific genius, von Doom ignored Richard's advice, and his experiments led to an accident in which he was facially scarred.  Following this event, Victor was expelled from school, and went out into the world, seeking a cure for his condition (which may or may not have been that serious in actuality).  All of this, reasonably or not, would lead him to a life-long enmity towards Reed Richards and the Fantastic Four. |||| |||| In Tibet, Victor spent time with Tibetan monks, learning further sorcerous secrets.  When the monks crafted a suit of mystical body armor, von Doom donned his mask before the iron face-plate had cooled, further disfiguring himself.  Later, the suit would be significantly improved by way of technological and magical enhancements. |||| |||| Now calling himself 'Doctor Doom', he returned to Latveria and promptly overthrew the country, installing himself as a (relatively) benevolent dictator.  Swearing himself to world domination and revenge on Reed Richards, Doom proceeded to enact any number of schemes to extend his personal power. |||| |||| In later years, after Doom extended his knowledge of mystical powers even further, his soul was consigned to Hell following further conflicts with Reed Richards.  Most recently, he appears to have returned to life after Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, passed through the Hell dimension on its way back to Earth."

It is capable of shooting small ice missiles or bullets with sufficient force and density to cut steel. The wearer can also make metal brittle by coming into direct contact with it. The wearer is effectively shielded from sub-zero temperatures the suit generates. It can also project enough cold to lower the temperature in a room from 68 to 32 degrees Fahrenheit in 30 seconds. However, the finite supply of water and moisture that the suit is able to take into its reserves is not sufficient enough to create giant ice bridges such as the mutant Iceman is capable of creating. |||| |||| The current costume has been improved upon by the members of the Thunderbolts formerly known as the Beetle and the Fixer. It can essentially emulate most of the powers originally wielded by Iceman, including the spontaneous generation of Ice Bridges for extremely swift and manueverable transportation (it does not give the wearer thermal vision).

Her strength is also at high superhuman level, sufficient to go one-on-one with She-Hulk.",,"Mary MacPherran was born prematurely to a poor family, both of which contributed to her small and fragile frame that she never quite grew out of. The more popular girls in high school would tease her with the name “Skeeter,” short for mosquito, and the name stuck. Her only friend was Marsha Rosenberg, herself a social outcast. Mary had only enough time for work and school and little else, and she spend her spare time dreaming of winning the lottery or of being struck with a sudden superhuman origin. |||| |||| One day, she happened upon one of the first sightings of Spider-Woman (Julia Carpenter). Caught up in the public fervor over her appearance, Mary claimed that she was Spider-Woman. The rumor got out, and the insinuation was enough to get her and Marsha invited to an important social function hosted by her high school rival. Unfortunately, this happened at the same time the Beyonder (now, the Maker) tore a section of Denver in order to create the Battleworld for a collection of Earth’s heroes and villains to fight each other. Mary was made an even bigger pariah when the real Spider-Woman appeared to save the party guests. Despondent and hopeless, Mary fled with Marsha only to encounter Doctor Doom. Doom offered the women a chance to become super-powered in exchange for joining his army. Mary agreed, and Doom used the alien technology of Battleworld to transform her into Titania and Marsha into Volcana. |||| |||| Titania and Volcana joined the other villains, where she immediately found company with the Absorbing Man, whose raw physical power she greatly admired. The villains successfully attacking the heroes’ fortress, and Titania managed to fight various X-Men to a standstill. She even seemed a match for She-Hulk; however, Titania failed to see the fight through and was forced to ask for help from the other super criminals. Her confidence shattered, she fought Spider-Man, but despite her superior strength, Spider-Man defeated her, and she has had a strong fear of facing Spider-Man in combat ever since. Soon, the villains banded together to escape with the Molecule Man, who used his power to return the Denver suburb to Earth. |||| |||| Titania and the Absorbing Man remained together as a couple, even participating in many crimes together. The two were recruited by Baron Zemo in his incarnation of the Masters of Evil, but they encountered the Wasp and Ant-Man (Scott Lang) before they could rendezvous with the team. Most often, though, Titania would seek out ways to pit herself against She-Hulk, always hoping to have the chance to redo the outcome of their initial fight, which Titania always considered her first true failure. Time and time again, however, She-Hulk would always best her. |||| |||| After many months, Titania and Absorbing Man got married, with Volcana as her bridesmaid. Although their large, super villain-filled wedding ceremony was interrupted by the Avengers, the heroes left Titania and the Absorbing Man alone. Both villains had seemed to have turned away from more malicious actions, preferring to quietly keep each other company, although they never gave up bank robberies and other activities completely. Titania and Absorbing Man occasionally continued to come into conflict with superheroes, such as the Black Widow, who, in a vendetta to dispose of all Avenger's villains, she shattered the Absorbing Man's altered form. (The Absorbing Man would later recover.) Later, the couple attempted to rob the high class restaurant Heaven's Grill, where they were stopped by Luke Cage and She-Hulk. |||| |||| Later still, the Absorbing Man returned to crime, revealing that Titania was dying of cancer and that he needed to pay for treatment. They kidnapped a doctor but were confronted by Thor, who convinced them to seek professional care. |||| |||| Titania soon recovered, but she became obsessed with the idea of besting She-Hulk. She trained in an all-consuming manner, so much so that she failed to notice when the Absorbing Man was remanded to police custody. She managed to boost her strength to unprecedented levels and raced to confront She-Hulk. With one punch, however, She-Hulk kayoed Titania. In fact, She-Hulk herself had similarly reached new levels of strength, as she had just come from training for an interstellar bout that pitted her against Tryco Slatterus, the Champion of the Universe. Now called the Fallen One because he lost the bout, Tryco offered Titania the use of his Infinity Gem of Power, training her with it so she could defeat She-Hulk. (After which, Titania promptly dropped a mountain on him, so he wouldn’t take the gem away.) |||| |||| Titania did indeed best She-Hulk and would have killed her if She-Hulk didn’t manage to slip away after transforming into her alter ego of Jennifer Walters. Awesome Andy, the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, and Spider-Man all tried to keep Titania at bay, but she defeated them all. Ultimately, Jennifer tricked Titania into thinking she killed She-Hulk, but it was really Ditto, a shape-changing process server. It was enough to allow Titania to fulfill her single-minded purpose, which released her hold on the Power Gem. Now She-Hulk, with a bigger overriding desire to see Titania thwarted, was able to wrest the gem from Titania’s brow and defeated her. She was imprisoned again, serving time at Pym Experimental Penitentiary Number One, a prison that kept its super-powered inmates miniaturized."

Unlike his father (who employs trick arrows from time to time), he uses a traditional bow and arrows. |||| |||| Due to Connor's training in the ashram, he can mimic fighting styles that he witnesses, though this is a learned skill and not a meta-human power. Writer Chuck Dixon used the Brotherhood of the Fist storyline to establish Connor as being among the best hand-to-hand combatants in the world. ||||",,"Connor Hawke met Oliver Queen after Ollie came to stay at the ashram where Connor had been studying for some years. Ollie had previously retreated to the ashram decades before, looking for peace after accidentally killing a criminal (in The Flash [2nd series] #217). Ollie returned to the ashram under similar circumstances, haunted by the thought that he had killed his former best friend Hal Jordan, who he at the time believed had gone insane and become the villain Parallax. Thanks to Connor, who was a big fan of Green Arrow, Ollie was able to regain a semblance of inner peace and venture out into the world again, especially after numerous attempts on his life had been made. |||| |||| Connor decided to journey with Ollie, and created a costume similar to his. Connor served as Ollie's sidekick, also meeting with Eddie Fyers, the former federal agent that acted as a form of counsel for Ollie. It was during this time that Ollie learned about his connection to Connor (albeit from the ghost of Hal Jordan): Connor was Ollie's son, conceived during Ollie's stay at the ashram twenty years before, a truth that Eddie Fyers had already deduced. Ollie didn't take it well and stormed off, agreeing to go undercover in an eco-terrorist group called the Eden Corps for the government. The mission turned out to be fatal for Ollie, as his arm was connected to a bomb in a plane that was headed for Metropolis. Rather than endanger Metropolis, and refusing to allow his arm to be amputated, he sacrificed himself to let the bomb explode away from the city. With his father dead, Connor decided to take up the mantle of Green Arrow and continue his hero's work. |||| |||| Connor continued to travel with Eddie, accompanied at times by Connor's martial arts mentor Master Jansen, as he tried to find his place not only in the hero world, but also in the legacy of Green Arrow. Akin to the friendship between his father and Hal Jordan, Connor became quick friends with the new Green Lantern Kyle Rayner, who himself was struggling to live up to a legacy. Connor also met Black Canary (Dinah Laurel Lance), Ollie's former and longtime romantic interest, who gave him one of Ollie's old bows, which Connor would use from then on (however, the news that Ollie was dead would send Black Canary, who was already suffering from a string of misfortunes – loss of income from the destruction of her florist shop and the loss of her superhuman ability – into a despair which would only be ended by her association with Oracle). |||| |||| Besides making friends, he also came face to face with Lady Shiva, said to be the deadliest assassin in the world, and was able to fight her almost to a stand-still, making him one of the very few to have survived battle with her. |||| |||| Connor also applied for membership in the JLA, taking his father's place. On what would be his second interview, he single-handedly saved the League from the hands of the Key. Connor defeated the Key's robots using his father's old trick arrows since his own were destroyed. In the end, he knocked out the Key using the famous boxing glove arrow, and was accepted as a member of the League. |||| |||| He would later be used by Batman as a 'traitor' in the League in a ploy to defeat Lex Luthor's Injustice Gang. Connor would leave the League afterward, feeling he was better suited for the street-level work and out of his element in the epic adventures of the Justice League, although he did remain on reserve status. He and Eddie would then return for a time to the ashram where Connor was raised, although they both often returned to the outside world, aiding Robin, Spoiler and Batgirl. |||| |||| When Ollie returned from the dead, Connor left the ashram and tracked him down. Connor and Ollie moved in together in Star City. The two live with Mia Dearden, a runaway that Ollie has taken in and trained as his new sidekick Speedy. Since returning to the superhero life, Connor has been wounded seriously twice, once by the villain called Onomatopoeia and once by Constantine Drakon, but he continues in his hero role. He is the voice of reason for Ollie, and the two have since formed a real father-son relationship. During his recovery from Onomatopoeia's attack, Oliver Queen and Roy Harper, his former sidekick, on a trip across the country recovering old possessions. One of them, was an old photograph, reveal that Oliver had been present at Connor's birth, but later ran from the responsibility of being a father. Oliver still keeps this fact from his son. |||| ||||"

480,Talia al Ghul (DC),,480_20051203103259_char.jpg,,,"Talia was the younger daughter of Ra's al Ghul, considered heir to his empire despite her independent streak. |||| She entered Batman's life when he rescued her from Dr. Ebenezer Darkk, who had recently split from Ra's League of Assassins. After her rescue, she shot and killed the man who had affronted her father. Batman's arrival caught her attention, and after telling the Demon's Head of this heroic figure, began a relationship that mixed passion with betrayal, love with deceit, and left the Dark Knight with a son. |||| |||| The entire Dr. Darkk incident was considered a test for Batman, gauging his suitability to assume control of the league and run Ra's operation. Ra's had Robin kidnapped, then introduced himself to Batman in the Batcave, noting that his own daughter was kidnapped in the same way. Batman's investigation and rescue of the pair convinced Ra's that Batman was a suitable heir, but the Dark Knight rejected the offer of Talia and Ra's business. |||| |||| From the beginning, Talia found herself drawn to Batman despite their differing views of the world. His outright rejection of her father's offer, and subsequent efforts to dismantle the league, only seemed to encourage her own independence. When Batman and Ra's dueled in the desert, he was struck by a scorpion; as he lay dying under the blazing sun, she slipped him the antidote. |||| |||| Little has been recorded about her early years or even who her mother was. She was clearly well educated in the arts and sciences in addition to being trained in weaponry and martial arts. She never knew her older half sister, Nyssa Raatko, and seemed to have been raised in isolation, under a's watchful eye. Her mother, of mixed Asian and Arabic descent, met the Demon's Head at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. One account indicated that the woman's name was Melisande, and that she was killed by one of Ra's servants, Qayin. Another account left the woman nameless and said she died from a drug overdose. Over the next several years Talia would turn up in Batman's life as ally or opponent, as the situation dictated. He continued to acknowledge but resist the attraction between them. At one point Ra's ga sed Batman, and when he awoke the Dark Knight discovered that Ra's had performed a marriage ceremony for him and Talia. The marriage remained unconsummated at that point: The Caped Crusader escaped and refused to acknowledge the bond. At some later point they did finally admit their attraction and love, which resulted in another ceremony, followed by the birth of their son, Damian. |||| |||| However, he continued to reject Talia so Ra's had her betrothed, instead, to Bane. She rejected the international brute, and after Batman defeated him, Ra's agreed that he was unworthy of his 'only' daughter. Talia remained affectionate toward her 'detective' but gave up on thoughts of a life together. Instead, she changed her focus toward charting her own destiny. |||| |||| She abandoned her father and, using the name Talia Head, accepted Lex Luthor's offer to run LexCorp when he took office as president of the United States. To seal the deal, she provided Lex with a disk containing details of her father's operations. Once she took over the conglomerate, Talia fed incriminating information about Luthor's operations to Superman and Batman, which helped lead to the president's downfall. She then sold off parts of the company to Wayne Enterprises. |||| |||| Talia returned to the family business when she was befriended by Nyssa, who proved to be her considerably older half sister, preserved, like their father, by the Lazarus Pits. Nyssa tortured Talia, killing and resurrecting her, using the moments of madness provided by a pit to turn Talia into her agent. In time, Talia located her fat er and finally killed him. Nyssa and Talia then assumed control of the League of Assassins. The changes hardened Talia's attitude toward Batman; she now opposed him more than allying herself with the Dark Knight. Additionally, after Batgirl killed Nyssa, Talia took control of the league, setting herself up as one of the most dangerous people on Earth. |||| |||| The five-foot-eight woman used her newfound position of Demon's Head to become a founding member of Lex Luthor's Society, a band of super villains dedicated to wiping out the planet's super heroes. She toured the world, recruiting members, punishing those who refused membership, and opposing the heroes whenever they turned up. After the events known as Infinite Crisis, Talia began her own schemes, which included obtaining Kirk Langstrom's Man-Bat formula and creating an army of man-bats. She intended to obtain weapons of mass destruction from the British military, sending her son Damian to distract Batman. In the end, Batman stopped the plan as Damian chose his mother over his father, and the pair seemingly died in an explosion. However, they survived the explosion, although her son was injured and required a transplant of his major organs."
