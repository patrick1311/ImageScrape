1194,Sinestro (DC),Thaal Sinestro ,1194_20070301182329_char.jpg,,,"A native of the planet Korugar in space sector 1417 (as the Guardians designate space), Sinestro was initially considered to be one of the greatest Green Lanterns, but as the years passed, he became more and more fixated not simply on protecting the magenta-skinned Korugarians, but on preserving order in their society. Eventually he concluded that the best way to accomplish this was to conquer them, and to rule the planet as a dictator. |||| |||| When Hal Jordan joined the Corps, Sinestro was assigned to be his instructor. Jordan was horrified at the way Sinestro ruled his people like a dictator, though Sinestro maintained that his iron-fisted rule was necessary to protect his people from alien forces. As such, while repelling the alien warlords known as the Khunds from attacking the planet, the Korugarians rebelled. When Jordan called for help from the other Green Lanterns, Sinestro's dictatorship was exposed and he was forced before the Guardians for punishment. Sinestro's Green Lantern Ring was given to Katma Tui, the leader of the rebellion who had felt that Sinestro's 'protection' kept his people from growing as a society through contact with other alien races. |||| |||| Punishment and villainy |||| |||| The Guardians decided to punish Sinestro by banishing him to the 'anti-matter universe', in particular, the alien world of Qward. Their motive for doing so was to humble Sinestro, by exiling him to a world ruled by evil and in particular, beings who hated the Guardians and the Green Lanterns. This would be a major miscalculation, as Sinestro instead was taken in by the Weaponers of Qward. The Weaponers were a group of warrior and scientists who hated the Guardians as much as Sinestro did and the two became allies, with the Weaponers offering to help Sinestro gain revenge on the Green Lantern Corps and the Guardians. |||| |||| Creating a yellow power ring for him to use, they sent him back to his home universe to seek his revenge. Sinestro quickly became a powerful nemesis toward the Green Lantern Corps, partially due to the fact that their power rings cannot directly affect anything yellow. Despite this, skilled Green Lanterns like Jordan always found ways to defeat him. |||| |||| Before the Guardians took a leave of absence from their universe to attempt mating with their counterparts the Zamarons, they constructed an inescapable prison for Sinestro and thousands of others on Oa. However, Sinestro's cunning prevailed once again and he managed to free himself through the mental manipulation of the Mad God of Sector 3600. Now wielding nearly unlimited power, Sinestro murdered entire star systems until he was finally subdued by the Green Lantern Corps of Earth. Now guilty of multiple acts of genocide, Sinestro was put on trial again by the assembled membership of the Green Lantern Corps. Finding him guilty, they condemned him to death and executed him, not realizing this activated a failsafe system within the Central Power Battery on Oa that caused it to be destroyed should ever a Korugarian male be killed by a Guardian or their agents (the failsafe was created by the Guardians after their mates, the Zamarons left them to live with Korugarians, a fact that they told no one out of jealousy and shame). Ironically, Sinestro's death then resulted (temporarily at least) in what he sought to achieve in life; the destruction of the Corps. He had also managed to cheat death itself by transferring his consciousness into the Central Power Battery, where he made a startling discovery about the ancient Yellow Impurity within the Green Lantern's light. |||| |||| The yellow impurity turned out to be a sentient entity known as Parallax and the two merged as Hal Jordan entered the battery to desperately try and save the few remaining Green Lanterns, whose power rings had not been rendered powerless by the death of Sinestro. Jordan ultimately defeated Sinestro, whose spirit was condemned to remain trapped inside the power battery for eternity. But for Sinestro, his was a victory that was greater: not only had he decimated the Green Lantern Corps, but through him, the yellow impurity entity Parallax had successfully infected Hal's mind, setting up Sinestro's ultimate triumph. |||| |||| Guy Gardner |||| |||| Guy Gardner, forced to forfeit his Green Lantern ring after a grudge match with Jordan, set out on a quest to regain his power and identity. With the help of Lobo, Gardner acquired the yellow power ring of Sinestro from Oa's Crypt of the Green Lantern Corps. The yellow ring did not use a battery to recharge but actually needed to be used against Green Lanterns to restore power. Gardner found this out by accident when a member of the GLC fought him while he had absolutely no power. |||| |||| As the yellow ring spoke Sinestro's native language, Guy was unable to communicate with it, although it seemed to understand him to a degree. |||| |||| Guy only wore the yellow ring for a short while as the character was caught up in the new editorial direction for the Green Lantern franchise that led to the controversial Emerald Twilight storyline in Green Lantern (vol. 3) #48-50 and it was decided to take the yellow ring from Gardner and completely reinvent the character. |||| |||| Ultimate Revenge |||| |||| In the meantime, the return of the Guardians resulted in the Corps being re-established, only to be attacked and annihilated by Jordan himself when he was possessed by the Parallax entity, and taking it's name. Driven mad with grief by the destruction of his home city and the apathy of the Guardians towards his plight, the yellow impurity pushed Hal towards a Parallax-induced homicidal rampage that left scores of Green Lanterns dead or maimed as Parallax sought to absorb the Central Power Battery's energies into his being. |||| |||| Sinestro was then revived by the Guardians and sent to stop Hal only to be murdered by his enemy. But Sinestro's death was not as it appeared, as he would later imply that the being that Jordan killed was a construct made by Parallax and unknowingly extracted from the Central Power Battery. |||| |||| Hal Jordan promptly finished off the Green Lantern Corps by absorbing the Central Power Battery's energies into himself. How Sinestro escaped remains unknown, but he survived and went into hiding as he watched Hal become what Sinestro had become: a traitor and a murderer reviled by his friends and his allies. |||| |||| Return |||| |||| Sinestro eventually revealed the charade when Kyle Rayner discovered the existence of Parallax and revealed it to Green Arrow and the Justice League. Nearly killing the two heroes, Sinestro was stopped by the newly resurrected Hal Jordan, who reclaimed his ring and was purged of Parallax's influence. The two fought to a draw, with Sinestro escaping to the anti-matter universe when his ring was damaged by Hal during the fight. |||| |||| Sinestro later appeared in the miniseries Villains United, where he captured Lady Quark for the Secret Society of Super-Villains. Sinestro had been a member of the group in the past and played a major role in the Society's massacre of the Freedom Fighters, with Sinestro murdering the second Black Condor early on. |||| |||| Sinestro also has engaged in other sinister schemes: with the Green Lantern Corps restarted with the return of Hal Jordan, Sinestro has decided to found his own Corps, offering yellow power rings, and a role in the Sinestro Corps, to the most feared and savage warriors of the universe. The size and scope of this new organization has yet to be revealed but stands to be a major threat for the Green Lantern Corps in the near future. |||| |||| In a recent interview with Geoff Johns, writer of the current Green Lantern series, [1] it was revealed that the Sinestro Corps are actually meant to mirror the GLC, to the minutest of details. Johns said, 'The Sinestro Corps [will have] its own Oa-type planet, its own Guardians, [and] its own oath.' |||| |||| Sinestro Corps |||| |||| Enslaving all the Qwardian Weaponeers, surveilled by Arkillo, a large and muscular vicious alien with the same role of Drill Sergeant held by Kilowog in the GLC, he forced them to continuously build new yellow rings, programmed to breach the barrier between anti-matter and matter universe, find and recruit new warriors. |||| |||| All Qwardians now sport slave collars, put on them by Sinestro himself to assure their loyalty, and the planet has now a huge yellow 'Central Battery', like the Oan one. |||| |||| Known members, other than the Corps namesake and Arkillo, include: Karu-sil, 'the girl next door' from a planet populated by murders and sociopaths; Despotellis, a sentient virus capable of attacking Lanterns from the inside; Bedovian, the sniper of the Corps, capable of taking out a target from three sectors away while living off of the fungus growing on his 'hermit crab' like shell. [1] |||| |||| Recently, the Sinestro Corps tried to recruit Batman, known for being able to instill fear into the hearts of man. Batman rejected the ring however, due to Batman's own willpower and his former exposure to a Green Lantern Corps ring. The ring, seeking a 'replacement' was sent to Amon Sur, the disgruntled son of Abin Sur, who was attempting to steal Hal Jordan's ring at the same moment"
1216,Blackfire,Komand'r ,1216_20070704171518_char.jpg,"Because of a Psion experiment, Komand'r's body is a massive solar battery capable of storing tremendous amounts of energy and then releasing it as destructive starbolts. Komand'r is also a highly trained warrior possessing a variety of combat skills.",,"Komand'r was born the eldest child of Tamaran's royal family. The first princess born in over a hundred years, she should have been courted and showered with honors. On the day she was born the Citadel Empire attacked and destroyed the western Tamaranean city of Kysarr and killed three thousand citizens in her name. Though she was in no way at fault for what had happened Komand'r was for all time inextricably linked with the terrible day. To make matters worse, Komand'r was crippled by a childhood illness that left her unable to absorb ultraviolet radiation to fly as most Tamaraneans did. |||| |||| Because of Komand'r's naturally grim disposition, a stark contrast to the royal family's generally contented outlook, the subjects of Tamaran hated her. As a result, though first in the line of succession, she was denied her birthright to be the next Princess of Tamaran to maintain respect and prestige of the royal family. Her privileges, honors, and her royal style and dignity were transferred to her younger sister, Princess Koriand'r (who would later become known as Starfire). Inwardly, Komand'r's rage grew and her resentment turned to hatred for her planet, her people, her family, and lastly her younger sister who, in Komand'r's eyes, made the fateful mistake of being born. |||| |||| Komand'r's rivalry continued and intensified when she and her siblings were sent, per Tamaran's warlike custom, for warrior training with the Warlords of Okaara. Komand'r's true feeling were exposed, when during a sparring exercise she attempted to kill her sister, the Princess Koriand'r. As a result, she was expelled by the Warlords. Humiliated by her own transgression Komand'r swore vengeance and joined the Citadel, quickly rising through their ranks to become a warrior fighting against the forces of her own planet and, ultimately, her own family. |||| |||| Betrayal |||| |||| Komand'r later betrayed her planet with detailed information about Tamaran's defenses to the Citadel. They conquered Tamaran with ease, and the surrender conditions included the enslavement of Koriand'r. Koriand'r was never permitted to return, since that would mean the Citadel would devastate the planet for abrogating the treaty. |||| |||| Komand'r was her sister's master and made the most of her younger sister's bondage with years of horrific servitude and torture. When Kory killed one of her rapists, Komand'r decided to execute her as punishment, but not before the sisters were attacked and captured by the Psions. |||| |||| Psions, largely a species of sadistic scientists, performed a deadly experiment on both of the sisters to see just how much energy their Tamaranian bodies could absorb before exploding from the overload. During the procedure, Komand'r's forces attacked the Psion ship to rescue her and while the Psions were distracted, Kory broke free with the starbolts, destructive blasts of solar energy, which were a result of the experimentation. Against her better judgment she decided to free Komand'r, who was still absorbing energy. However, far from grateful, Komand'r struck her sister down with the same (but more intensified), power and had her restrained for later execution. Kory escaped and stole a space ship to planet Earth, where she met a young group of heroes and helped form the new Teen Titans. |||| |||| Infinite Crisis and aftermath |||| |||| Komand'r recently appeared in the Rann-Thanagar War limited series, during which she killed Hawkwoman in her pursuit of a New Tamaran. She formed an uneasy alliance with the surviving players of the War, in order to deal with more pressing concerns (Infinite Crisis). She was not seen during the Crisis itself, and has recently appeared in Hawkgirl and JSA Classified, attempting to kill Hawkman and Hawkgirl. The Hawks defeated Komand'r, after which Hawkman used Psion technology to strip the villain of her starbolt powers."

After a 1000 years of travel Vance is shocked to find humans have already landed and colonized the planet.  Vance also finds that he can not take off his space suit for fear of dying from exposure.  He later forms the Guardians of the Galaxy with Martinex and Charlie-27.  They aim to be the 30th centuries version of the Avengers.  In one of his adventures he meets his younger self and changes the time line so that his powers reveal themselves earlier in his life.  Thus making the Guardians time-line an alternative version.
3087,Charlie-27 (Marvel),,3087_20060315071732_char.jpg,Super Strength,,"Charlie-27 is a soldier, genetically engineered to live in Jupiter's gravity. As such, he has eleven times the muscle mass of a normal human. He is a founding member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. He once had a romantic relationship with fellow Guardian Nikki, but the two broke it off. They still remain friends. |||| |||| Though from the future, Charlie-27 manages to become involved in the Infinity War. He and his team save Avengers Mansion from an invasion by the Masters of Evil. Then both teams save each other from waves of evil doubles based on both teams. |||| |||| Rita Demara once earned his friendship by performing an impromptu surgery with her stings on a massive internal blood-clot, saving his life. |||| |||| As with the rest of the team, Charlie's last appearance is on a mysterious planet as the team had become lost in space and time."
406,Speedball (Marvel)(01 - Robbie Baldwin),Robert Baldwin ,406_20070101171449_char.jpg,"Robbie Baldwin's exposure to energy from a dimension of kinetic energy gave him the superhuman ability to create a kinetic field of unknown energy around himself which absorbs all kinetic energy directed against him (what he originally called the 'Speedball Effect.') This absorption can vary from resisting the effects of physical objects such as bricks and rocks to resisting that of energy and fire and even explosions. Within his kinetic field it is nearly impossible for him to be hurt, and he instead bounces harmlessly from object to object, with no loss or transference of momentum. |||| When transformed into Speedball, he is covered with a blue-and-gold costume (originally a facsimile of the lab uniform he wore when exposed to the energy) and surrounded by a display of multi-colored bubbles. At first, Robbie would transform uncontrollably if hit with a slight force, but eventually became able to activate the effect consciously. He typically uses the field to slam into his opponents, and the multi-colored light display can be used to distract opponents. After many years, Robbie has learned to extend the kinetic field outward, pushing back everything in his immediate area or, by focusing more locally, delivering more powerful blows in hand-to-hand combat.",,"Robbie Baldwin is the son of Justin Baldwin, District Attorney of Springdale, Connecticut, and Maddy Naylor-Baldwin, a popular actress. His parents held very opposite views and often argued in front of Robbie, a fact made more poignant as their arguments often had to do with what Robbie should be doing with his life and future career. |||| |||| As a high school student, Robbie was interning at the Hammond Research Laboratory in Connecticut. There, Doctor Benson and two colleagues began the final stages of their attempts to tap an extra-dimensional energy source, but the researchers did not construct adequate safeguards and the energies began to overload Hammond Labs' equipment. Part of the energies fed back into the generator, shorting out the entire system. Unfortunately, Robbie had sneaked into the lab where the experiment was taking place, curious as to what all the hush-hush preparations had been for. Robbie was bombarded by energy from the dimension but survived, finding himself surrounded by weird energy bubbles, clad in an odd costume, and having a hollow and resonant voice. Panicking, Robbie sought to escape to the roof of the lab building where he encountered four masked gunmen. During the ensuing battle, Robbie discovered that his body now generated a kinetic energy field that protected him from any impact and made him a bouncing dynamo of kinetic energy. |||| |||| Shortly afterward, Robbie's parents were accosted by Johnny Roarke, a criminal Justin Baldwin had put away, and Robbie used his powers to defeat him. The media leaped to the story, reporting the appearance of a new hero, whom they dubbed 'the Masked Marvel.' Robbie continued to use his powers to fight crime, and the Masked Marvel enjoyed a great deal of popularity from the townspeople, although his parents held very diametrical and vocal views about the costumed vigilante. Baldwin was forced to keep his power under control, avoiding any potential contact that might trigger his powers. He also spent much of his time trying capture Dr. Benson's cat, Niels, who was similarly caught in the energy experiment and gained Speedball-like powers, and using him to help understand his powers. |||| |||| During a trip to New York City, Robbie ended up helping Spider-Man and Daredevil stop the Purifiers of the High Evolutionary, but mostly Robbie fought criminals in Springdale, such as the Sticker, Leaper Logan, the Bug-Eyed Voice, and the Feathered Felon. Robbie hoped to become a big-time superhero, and even joined a tryout for the premier hero team Avengers, only to be rejected. During a shopping trip to New York City with his mother he saw a battle breaking out involving Terrax, former herald of Galactus. Joining the fray along with the other heroes that would subsequently become the founding members of the New Warriors, Robbie agreed to join the team as well after Terrax was defeated. |||| |||| Despite the long distance he often had to travel, Robbie stayed with the New Warriors for a long tenure, quickly becoming an annoying but loveable kid brother to the older Warriors and continuing to grow in the development of his powers. Shortly after joining the team, he asked his teammates to assist him in investigating the long absence of his mother, who had joined a fanatical ecological watchdog group, Project: Earth. The Warriors discovered the group wanted to kill Baldwin's mother, as her celebrity would serve to make her a martyr to their cause. Robbie helped save his mother and defeat Project: Earth, and in so doing he revealed his secret identity to her. Although shaken, she supported her son's lifestyle as a superhero. |||| |||| Speedball had battled numerous villains with the New Warriors, including Terrax, the Sphinx, the Puppet Master, Gideon, Force of Nature, Psionex, and the Folding Circle. At one point, the cosmic villain Magus created evil doppelgangers of Earth's heroes, and Robbie's duplicate used its powers to virtually destroy the town of Springdale. It also confronted Robbie's parents, and Robbie was forced to kill his duplicate. This led to his father discovering his secret identity, and Justin Baldwin denounced his son because of what he saw as vigilantism. |||| |||| Robbie’s parents got divorced, and Robbie chose to live with his mom in New York. This allowed him to develop deeper relationships with his teammates, notably Nova, Rage, and, perhaps more reluctantly, his neighbor Carlton LaFroyge (who used the knowledge of Robbie’s identity to force his way onto the team as Hindsight Lad.) |||| |||| When Timeslip joined the Warriors, telling of her visions of Speedball’s death, she and Robbie nevertheless developed the beginnings of a romantic friendship while seeking the truth behind these visions. At the same time, despite Speedball’s ever-increasing control over his powers, Robbie began experiencing severe spikes in his power levels that wreaked havoc over his immediate area. The Warriors were confronted by the Sphinx, who claimed the presence of Speedball was creating chaos with time itself. They were also confronted with the evil techno-organic being Advent. The Sphinx succeeded in killing Speedball before escaping, and Advent left for the future. Timeslip, holding Speedball when he died, received memories from him in his dying moments-- memories of a citizen from the future named Darrion Grobe. Grobe, the son of the man who would become Advent, hoped to undo the meddling his father had caused by traveling through the kinetic dimension to the past. He used futuristic technology to become a duplicate Robbie Baldwin/Speedball, replacing Speedball when he was trapped in the kinetic dimension by the Sphinx several months before. Timeslip used her knowledge and powers to transport the New Warriors to the future. There, a holographic persona of Darrion helped the Warriors to undo all of Advent's manipulations. Ultimately, the team had to enter the kinetic dimension to escape the future before it became re-made, and they brought back the true Speedball while returning home. |||| |||| Robbie has always been a New Warrior at heart. Even when the team seemed to be on a long hiatus, he and Nova helped re-form the Warriors to defeat Blastaar, adding new members Aegis and Bolt. Robbie and Nova even tried to pitch the New Warriors as an animated series, but they were forced to flee when they saw the producers’ unique take on the team. Nevertheless, Speedball returned when the New Warriors were led by Night Thrasher into a unique re-branding as a reality-TV show. Robbie’s bouncy personality seemed a perfect fit despite the contentions of other teammates, and the team hit the road to become heroes for the common man throughout small-town America. Eventually the New Warriors encountered Nitro, Speedfreek, Cobalt Man, and Coldheart and during the battle that followed Nitro used his power and caused a massive explosion killing the New Warriors and almost everyone around that area for an unknown distance. Speedball was seemingly killed during this explosion and was later ridiculed by TV talk show hosts."

Her mother died when giving birth and Luchino wanted his daughter to lead a respectable life, so he gave the child to Byron Frost and his wife Loretta to be raised. Byron Frost was a wealthy financier and an employee of Nefaria. He called the child Whitney and raised her as his own. |||| As a young adult, Whitney became engaged to politician Roger Vane. The Frosts died and Count Nefaria approached Whitney and revealed her true parentage. He told Whitney that he wanted her to take his place as leader of the Maggia, a Mafia-like organisation on the East Coast of the United States. Whitney at first refused, but when she told Roger about her father, he left her, afraid that her connections to a known criminal would hamper his political career. |||| Whitney accepted her father's offer and was trained by him in strategy, criminal activities and combat. She turned out to be a brilliant student and when her father was imprisoned, she became the new Big M, the leader of the Nefaria Maggia. Her role as Big M brought her into conflict with Iron Man and after a raid on his company, Stark Industries, Whitney was forced to flee. Her plane crashed though and Whitney's face was scarred during the accident. She was saved by the criminal Mordecai Midas and started to work for him. Midas was obsessed with gold and Whitney hid her face behind a golden mask and used the alias 'Madame Masque'. |||| Madame Masque met Tony Stark, Iron Man's alter-ego and he showed concern for her, despite her scarred face. She turned on Midas to save Stark, but left Stark because of her criminal past. Unable to forget him, she returned as Krissy Longfellow, Stark's personal secretary. Both came to know of each other's secret identity and started a romantic relationship. Their happiness was short-lived though; her father was dying as the result of an attempt to gain superhuman powers. Whitney hired the Ani-Men to bring her father to her and then asked Stark to find a cure for him. Nefaria tried to use violence to force Stark and a battle started between the Ani-Men and Iron Man. During the battle Whitney was unable to chose between her father and her lover and when Nefaria's life support was damaged in the fight, she went insane with guilt and grief. |||| Whitney returned to the Nefaria Maggia and as 'The Director' became its leader. She often fought Iron Man and his friends. At one point, Whitney became paranoid and started to create copies of herself, known as bio-duplicates. One of her bio-duplicates, known as Masque, was an ally of the Avengers. Whitney later ordered Masque exterminated for its aberrant behaviour."

She is also in superior physical condition due to her Inhuman physiology, though she is abnormally vulnerable to pollutants.",,"Crystal was born into the royal family of the Inhumans, a hidden race preoccupied with genetics. The Inhumans developed the Terrigan Mists, a mutagenic compound routinely applied to Inhuman children, as with Crystal, who was exposed in infancy. |||| |||| When Crystal's sister Medusa disappeared, Crystal and other Inhuman royalty searched the globe for her, ultimately finding her and returning to Attilan with the aid of the Fantastic Four. Along the way, a passionate romance blossomed between Crystal and the Human Torch. Though they were at first kept apart by her Inhuman family, and later a Negative Zone barrier that Maximus created around Attilan. But after Black Bolt used his powerful voice to destroy the barrier, the Inhuman's Council of Elders soon made the decision to split up the royal family while the city was being rebuilt. Then Crystal and her cousins left their sanctuary, with Black Bolt's agreement. Crystal was finally free to pursue Johnny, and with Black Bolt's approval, she rejoined him. Together with the Fantastic Four, she helped fight the newly escaped Blastaar, and continued to assist them, though she was usually restrained from active participation by an overly concerned Johnny Storm. Eventually, when the Invisible Girl gave birth to her first child, Crystal made herself a Fantastic Four uniform and announced that she would be her replacement. Skeptical, Mister Fantastic agreed to think about it, but after stopping the newest series of attacks from the criminal, Wizard, Crystal earned her place on the Marvel Universe's first family. Crystal was later captured by Maximus, using a controlled Lockjaw, after he had retaken the Inhuman throne. But Black Bolt once again used his destructive voice to free them and send Maximus scurrying to a hidden rocket. Crystal first had to leave the Fantastic Four when Black Bolt injured himself in a radiation experiment, and he needed her to use her powers to vibrate his heart until Gorgon could return with medicine. Crystal was finally forced to leave the team when she passed out and Reed discovered that Earth's pollutants were slowly killing her. Johnny took it badly, but Reed stopped him before he could jump into Lockjaw's teleportation field. |||| |||| En route to Attilan, Crystal rescued and tended the wounded Quicksilver. A whirlwind romance ensued, and by the time Quicksilver had recovered, they were engaged. Crystal and Quicksilver were married and settled down in Attilan, the first-ever Inhuman marriage to a non-Inhuman. At first, Crystal and Pietro were very happy together, especially after Crystal gave birth to their daughter Luna; but serious tensions arose. Pietro wanted to expose Luna to the Terrigan Mists rather than have her remain an ordinary girl, but Crystal forbade it. Quicksilver immersed himself in his role as commander of the Inhuman militia, while a lonely and bored Crystal had an affair with a real estate salesman Norm Webster. When Pietro found out, he went mad and fled Attilan. Crystal rejoined the Fantastic Four, trying unsuccessfully to rekindle her old romance with Johnny. |||| |||| Pietro eventually recovered from his breakdown, and he and Crystal have made several attempts at reconciliation, including a period during which they served together as Avengers. Crystal joined their ranks as her way of atoning for her various personal failures. However, Crystal's romantic link to the team's Black Knight helped sour the marriage yet again, and the couple have been separated as of late."

His mutant ability operates by tapping into the Darkforce dimension, as several other Marvel Universe teleporters (such as Cloak, the Vanisher, Silhouette, etc.) do. Originally, his all-black appearance was a costume of apparently conventional material, with stark white eyepieces in the mask as contrast. However, since becoming Oblivion's servant, his Doorman 'body' seems to be an assumed shape rather than a simple costume, and he can transform at will from this form to his non-costumed self. |||| |||| He also gained the ability to collect the souls of the recently deceased and deliver them to Oblivion; while doing so, he appears visible only to the soul he is collecting, and possibly also his teammate Mr. Immortal, who could perceive the original Deathurge. What other new powers he has gained from his new position, if any, are currently unknown.",,"Little is known of Doorman's life before he responded to Mr. Immortal's advertisement for a hero team. This team would eventually become the Great Lakes Avengers. It has been revealed however that he is a mutant. |||| |||| Before joining the Great Lakes Avengers, DeMarr Davis was an average American youngster.

Zaran (one of Batroc's henchmen) threw a sai at Doorman, who quickly activated his powers, only for the blade to land directly in the head of Grasshopper (who was standing right behind him), killing him instantly. DeMarr feels that it is his fault that Grasshopper died and therefore sunk into a slight depression. During this time he also tried to scare another new member, Squirrel Girl off of the team because he feared that she too would die while in service to the GLA. |||| |||| Doorman himself has died as well, sacrificing himself so that Mr. Immortal could stop the villain Maelstrom. He met with the other dead GLA'ers in the afterlife including Grasshopper who forgave him. Doorman was however intrigued by the absence of Hawkeye. Shortly afterwards, he was summoned by the cosmic entity Oblivion, who declared that thanks to Doorman's connection to the Darkforce dimension, Doorman could prove useful to him, akin to Deathurge who had recently been captured by Mr. Immortal. Doorman therefore replaced Deathurge and became Oblivion's new angel of death. |||| |||| Taking Deathurge's place, Doorman took Maelstrom to the afterlife after he was tricked into killing himself by Mr. Immortal, and was able to return to the GLA. What other effects his new role as servant of Oblivion have had on him have yet to be revealed. Doorman continues to be a member of the GLA, although after he helped his friends save the world from Maelstrom, he understands the team's importance and has a newfound respect for them. However, a subpoena from the real Avengers forced the team to change their name to the Great Lakes X-Men or GLX. |||| |||| Some time after the battle with Maelstrom, Doorman was celebrating Christmas with the rest of the GLX when he informed the team that he had to go and visit his father. Upon reaching his father's house, his father quickly complained that DeMarr was throwing his life away and needed to join the real world. He told his son that he had 'stupid powers' and 'all the other heroes have better powers than you.' Realizing that his own happiness was more important than his father's respect, DeMarr finally admitted the truth to his father: that he had died and came back as the angel of death. He had not come back to visit his father but rather to collect his soul as he had fallen off the roof while setting up Christmas lights and died. Ironically, the revelation of DeMarr's new role in the universe greatly pleased his father, who couldn't wait to brag to all his friends in heaven about how his son was the new angel of death. |||| |||| Doorman and his teammates recently participated in a charity superhero poker tournament hosted by the Thing, where Flatman beat their host in the final round. Flatman's status as champion inspired the team to take the new name of the Great Lakes Champions, after being discouraged from affiliation with both the X-Men and the Defenders by members of those teams present at the tournament, ignoring former Champions of Los Angeles member Hercules' protests."

Though his original design was purely for study and research. However, the alchemist Diablo soon escaped from his melted, stone prison and offered Gilbert the means to animate the Dragon Man. Gilbert had no choice but to accept and together they used Diablo’s potions and a chunk of rock from outer space to give life to Dragon Man. |||| |||| Diablo immediately ordered Dragon Man to destroy his enemies, the Fantastic Four, starting with the Thing, who had witnessed his animation. The Dragon Man dutifully attacked Ben, and later, the rest of the Fantastic Four. He used his fire breath on the Human Torch, who absorbed it, but was forced to fly into the upper atmosphere to release the pent up heat before he melted everything around him. To save her brother, the Invisible Girl pinned his wings and the Dragon Man fell to the earth. She sensed that Dragon Man was not malicious, however, and tried to comfort him. He responded to her touch by reaching out to stroke her hair, but Diablo returned and gassed the three members of the Fantastic Four with a freezing potion. |||| |||| Along with his creator, Professor Gilbert, Dragon Man and Diablo faced the Fantastic Four minutes later at the edge of Dead Man’s Lake. But before Diablo could throw another freezing pellet at the four, Dragon Man lashed out with his tail and knocked the pellet out of Diablo’s hand, accidentally freezing the lake instead. Dragon Man then chased Diablo across the frozen lake until they fell through, into the bitter-cold waters. The Thing tried to follow but found that the lake had caves underneath that created a vicious undertow and they gave Diablo and the Dragon Man up as lost. But his creator stayed behind at State U to hold a vigil over the lake in case Dragon Man ever returned, so that he could undo the wrong that had been done in his creation. |||| |||| Soon, a struggle between the Human Torch and the Inhuman Medusa changed the temperature of Dragon Man’s prison enough to allow him to break free. He attacked them, but confused Medusa for the Invisible Girl, and guarded her. He continued to guard her as the Fantastic Four fought her and her Inhuman family, until Susan encouraged him to join them, but was forced to tranquilize him later when the Thing startled him into anger. Eventually the Seeker, who confused him for an Inhuman, captured him; but when he realized he was of the Earth, he had no more use for him. Though the Dragon Man awoke in shackles and broke out, full of distrust for the human race once again, until the Torch and the Thing managed to subdue him. Mister Fantastic later contacted the authorities who took him to a Desert Isle Sanctuary, under heavy sedation, for examination."
7850,Asgardian (Marvel),William Kaplan ,7850_20070813220104_char.jpg,"As Wiccan, Billy Kaplan possesses a spellcasting talent that may or may not be related to a reality warping power. While patterning himself after Thor in the guise of Asgardian, Billy limited himself entirely to flight and lightning based spells. Also he can astral project by fear until he learns how to control it. By stating an intent and focusing on the outcome, Wiccan is capable of a variety of feats, including, but not limited to tracking and locating others, illusionary disguises, tearing down forcefields, mass teleportation, concussive blasts, enchantments, and telekinetic force beams. |||| |||| It was revealed in Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways that Billy must be able to hear his spells for them to be successful, but some of Billy's spells can be activated without words. He has consistently been able to create force fields, teleport others,and generate lightning and force blasts with little or no effort.",,"Billy Kaplan is the eldest of three sons born to Reform Jews Jeff Kaplan (a cardiologist ) and Rebecca Kaplan (a psychologist) |||| |||| Regularly bullied in school, Billy found solace outside the gates of the Avengers Mansion. One day, Billy encountered the Avenger the Scarlet Witch, who told him to stand his ground the next time it happens. She then touched his head, causing a red light to flash briefly. The flash heals Billy's wounds and a few weeks later he stands up for another kid being bullied, and demonstrates his powers for the first time, but is not fully prepared for their effects. |||| |||| He was one of the Young Avengers chosen as a result of the Vision's plan for the reformation of the Avengers, in the event the team ever disbanded. He originally chose the code name Asgardian, but later changed it to Wiccan. |||| |||| The full extent of his powers are unknown, though they include flight and lightning generation. He can cast spells using a technique learned from 'self-help books' owned by fellow Young Avenger Hulkling's mother. By chanting a mantra/statement of intent (for example, 'I want Iron Lad to forget') and focusing on the outcome he wants to achieve, he can cause different events and effects to happen. |||| |||| Billy has said that Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, was his favorite Avenger, and it has been implied that his powers are linked to hers. Billy's possible relationship to Wanda was revealed by the Super-Skrull and Vision. |||| |||| In the past, Scarlet Witch was so desperate to have children that she used her reality warping powers to create twin sons out of fragments of the soul of the demon Mephisto. When the boys' souls were reabsorbed into Mephisto, because of the power Wanda put into the soul fragments, they destroyed him and their souls were reincarnated as Thomas Shepherd, the Young Avenger Speed, and Billy. |||| |||| During the Civil War, Billy and Tommy plan to look for Wanda. They hope that revelation that her sons appear to be alive and well will aid in her recovery. However, their plan is disrupted by the attack by the Zodiac on the United Nations and the subsequent events of the Civil War. |||| |||| S.H.I.E.L.D. arrests the Young Avengers. However, Sam Wilson (Falcon) and Steve Rogers (Captain America) intercept the S.H.I.E.L.D bus which is transporting the prisoners and Wiccan teleports the team out of the situation, into the Resistance Fighters base of operations. |||| |||| When the Runaways try to stay out of the conflict, they barely manage to escape from the government forces. Hearing of this development in the news, the Young Avengers decide to help the Runaways even though Captain America vetoes the plan. Wiccan uses his magic to locate and teleport to the Runaways. However, the Runaways believe that the Young Avengers have come to capture them and a fight ensues until Eli (Patriot) succeeds in convincing Nico to stop the hostilities. The two teams are later attacked by Noh-Varr, who captures Wiccan and Hulkling, and (apparently) kills the Runaway Xavin. The young heroes become the prisoners of the Warden, who proceeds to practice vivisection on the unconscious Teddy. This has little physical effect on Hulkling, whose vital organs keep shifting out of the way of the Warden's knife, but it does have a strong psychological effect on Billy, who cries out, 'I want you to die.' (He is subsequently very grieved that he has been manipulated into so much hatred.) The boys are rescued by Xavin, whose Skrull physiology allowed him to recover from Noh-Varr's attack. He comes close to killing the Warden, but Teddy stops him. |||| |||| Wiccan is among the Secret Avengers who takes part in the first major battle of the Civil War and was one of the first two casualties. Tony Stark and Peter Parker realize that the two rebels with teleportation powers needed to be incapacitated to prevent an escape from the ambush. So, Wiccan and Cloak are shot with tranquilizer darts and rendered unconscious. This attack on two of his youngest followers infuriates Steve Rogers (Captain America). A violent battle ensues, by the end of which, Goliath lies dead, slain by the cyborg clone of Thor. Most of the Anti-Registration group escapes, but Wiccan is left behind and captured by the Pro-Registration side. |||| |||| Billy and the other imprisoned anti-Registration heroes are eventually freed in a raid led by Captain America. This liberation is made possible largely by Teddy's shape-shifting ability, which allows him to mimic Hank Pym's retinal and voice patterns, and thereby release all the prisoners from their cells. |||| ||||"
1281,Terrax the Tamer (Marvel),Tyros ,1281_20070113201446_char.jpg,"Terrax was apparently born with a limited mental control over rock and earth, which he used to create simple constructs. After his powers were enhanced by Galactus, his ability increased in terms of volume and complexity. He was also awarded superhuman strength and durability, as well as abilities including force field projection, matter manipulation, the power to fuse machinery, energy absoprtion (usually through his axe), resistance to telepathy, and more. Like all of Galactus's Heralds, he is immune to the vacuum of space. His cosmic-powered axe is magically sharp and can generate waves of force (he himself can project personal energy attacks as well). Originally he could fly through space on his own by riding masses of stone which he levitated, but after taking over a human body (Harmon Furmintz, the creator of Psionex), he needed the additional power of his axe to travel through space. Terrax is also a gifted and adaptable close combat fighter.",,"Terrax was originally known as Tyros, ruler of the city Lanlak on the planetoid Birj, which was a satellite of the gas giant Marman. Tyros possessed limited powers over the elements of earth and he abused these powers in order to become tyrant over his people. Tyros was ruthless and cruel, which brought him to the attention of Galactus, who had decided that the weakness of his former Heralds had been their compassion. Galactus compelled the Fantastic Four against their will to retrieve Tyros for him, in exchange for assisting the Four in combatting the Sphinx. |||| |||| Empowered with the 'Power Cosmic,' Tyros became 'Terrax the Tamer, master of all things rock and earth.' But his ambition and power-lust drove him to challenge Galactus, who easily defeated him by stripping away the power cosmic. |||| |||| Later, in the 'Trial of Galactus' story-arc in Fantastic Four, Doctor Doom used his technological expertise to restore some of Terrax's former power, in exchange for his help in destroying the Fantastic Four. During the battle, Silver Surfer appeared and ultimately destroyed him. |||| |||| Notable appearances include New Warriors issue #1, in which a re-embodied Terrax is the threat that unites the fledgling super-hero team; and Fantastic Four Issue #258, in which he waxes nostalgic about his destructive powers. Shortly afterward, Terrax engaged the Silver Surfer and was marooned on an uninhabited, grassy planet and his axe was cast into a nearby asteroid field. During the Herald Ordeal, Silver Surfer lead a group of former Galactean heralds in opposition to Morg, Galactus' then Herald. In Silver Surfer #74, Terrax was the last former herald that the Silver Surfer collected by saving him from that unnamed planet and finding his axe. In issue #75, Terrax joins the other heralds in battling Morg. Morg and Terrax take almost instantly to a rivalry, as they are the only two heralds that wield axes and both enjoy fights. During the battle, Terrax' axe crumbles and Morg successfully knocks him out. After the battle, Terrax takes the recently deceased Morg's axe and takes to the stars on an asteroid, content to never see any of his allies again. Presumably between Silver Surfer #75 and #81, Terrax is captured by Tyrant where he is held with several others who are less than enthusiastic to share his company. Terrax and his fellow prisoners manage to free themselves, and Terrax again takes off, wanting only to be left alone. |||| |||| In the Cosmic Powers mini-series, Terrax is recruited by Thanos of Titan to again fight Tyrant. Issue #2 focuses on Terrax, and opens with him fighting in a very Roman looking arena. He wins the battle and wins the one thing he probably has the least use for in all the world - a beautiful woman. She leads him into the desert with promises of riches for her safe return, but he is ambushed by her brothers. Thanos comes in at the tail end of the slaughter, and the woman appeals to him to save her from Terrax, to which his response is that she had made her bed and it was time to lie in it. Terrax lets Thanos know that he is ready to battle him, and Thanos replies that he offers vengeance against Tyrant. Terrax then helps Thanos recruit Ganymede and eventually Legacy and Jack of Hearts, who are collectively betrayed by Thanos. While Thanos is battling Tyrant, Terrax and the others flee in Thanos' craft, the Demeter. |||| |||| Another notable appearance was in the humor book the GLX Christmas Special, where he and other villains were beaten easily by Squirrel Girl. |||| |||| He also appeared in the The Sentry as a momentary annoyance mostly to display Sentry's level of power. He takes Terrax's axe away from him and further humiliates 'the tamer' by shattering it with his bare hands. Terrax's portrayal in the series has been called into question, as he uncharacteristically and inexplicably is first found fighting random helicopters on Earth and babbling about pseudo-environmental outrages. |||| |||| In the events of Annihilation: Silver Surfer, Terrax has been captured by Annihilus' forces for an unknown purpose. In the Heralds of Galactus two parter following the events of Annihilation Terrax is freed from the control of the negative zone life forms and with Paibok and the infant like alien escapes to a desolate planet controlled by Randu the space parasite. Terrax destroys it but looses a female Centaurion who he seems to have been attracted to during the battle. In his anger over her loss and the dismayed behavior of Randu's other victims who had come to rely on their captur he destroys the planet. He is currently flying about through space and at this time its unknown what if any part he will play in Annihilation: Conquest."
14839,Twitch Williams,Maximilian Steven Percival 'Twitch' Williams III ,14839_20100608102818_char.jpg,,,"In this duo of detectives Twitch is mainly seen as the 'brains' of the group. He is the one who usually solves or puts the pieces together in the rare crimes the detectives encounter. A brilliant mathematician who excelled at trigonometry, he has used his knowledge of angles to become an excellent marksman. A shooting prodigy, Twitch makes up for his small size with his ability to handle twin pistols with almost machine-like accuracy and efficiency. He earned the nickname 'Twitch,' as Sam once said, 'because he doesn't, ever!' He refers to Sam Burke as 'sir,' as throughout the years Sam has, time and time again, earned his trust and respect. At the beginning of their story/comic book we find the two employed as a private investigation firm known as 'Burke and Williams' however, this does not last, since the two are called back into duty by their old captain. |||| |||| Twitch was once married and has several children, but due to his busy schedule with crime cases, his wife eventually divorced him, and denies him custody of his kids. This has a great emotional impact on Twitch, but does not seem to hinder him from his work. Twitch comes from a family with a proud tradition in law enforcement, his father and siblings all being cops themselves. Despite his reserved and soft-spoken manner, he is extremely passionate and proud of his job, in some ways more so than Sam. It is because of this that, despite his incredible intelligence, the apparent rampant corruption of the Police Department which he works for troubles him greatly. In some ways, Twitch is a little more naïve than the street-smart and more realistic Sam, and has had to deal with many harsh truths. Despite this, however, Twitch never loses his resolve to be a good cop, even amongst corruption and a city that generally doesn't trust the police. Twitch often makes better relations with people than his partner, due to his kinder, more thoughtful way with people. |||| |||| Twitch has also battled against many super-human foes in his past. Of particular note is OvertKill, a monstrous, mafia-hired cyborg from the Spawn comic series. Despite OvertKill's seemingly-bulletproof exterior, Twitch was able to defeat him with a single, well-aimed bullet through OvertKill's ear canal. While Twitch lacks Sam's strength, size, and tenacity, he makes up for it with calm and collected nerves of steel and immensely quick thinking under pressure. Combined with his marksmanship, he's not one to be trifled with."

2296,Plasmus,Otto Von Furth ,2296_20070502231139_char.jpg,"With his radioactive and chemically-converted body, Plasmus' touch can bring a fiery death onto his opponents reverting them to a protoplasmic state. The touch has no cure and no one has withstood it. Plasmus can also loosen his cells so that bullets can't hurt him. He is also able to gather his body if it is scattered while in its less cohesive state. In a certain sense, he is almost identical to the sinister Preston Payne, the third Clayface. Both can, as noted above, melt people into protoplasmic jelly, are little less than inhuman themselves, and have a great deal of control above their bodies.",,"Otto Von Furth was a mine worker in East Berlin, Germany until an unexpected cave-in trapped him and four fellow miners for seven days. During those days, Otto's co-workers died, leaving him as the only survivor. He and his fellow miners had been mining for radioactive radium and ended up exposed to it and when rescued, he was rushed to the hospital. Otto was later kidnapped by Ex-Nazi General Zahl who mutated him into a blob-like state. With his anger, Otto became Plasmus. His body changed into an unstable protoplasm and he was brought into the Brotherhood of Evil where he took the name Plasmus. He and the Brotherhood of Evil fought the Teen Titans on different occasion where he enjoys fighting and regretting not being the one to kill General Zahl. The rest of the Brotherhood of Evil reformed into the Society of Sin. He was later recruited into Lex Luthor's Suicide Squad where he died fighting Imperiex."

394,Black Knight (Marvel)(03 - Dane Whitman),Dane Whitman ,394_20060314171247_char.jpg,"Highly intelligent, Dane is a trained unarmed combatant, superb swordsman, and expert horseman. Though specializing in physics, he is proficient in a wide array of advanced sciences and technologies, including genetic and mechanical engineering. He has strong strategic and tactical skills. |||| |||| Dane's past weapons include the legendary Ebony Blade, his power lance and his laser sword. The Ebony Blade, created by the wizard Merlin, is an indestructible, enchanted sword forged of magic and a unique meteorite that fell to Earth in the Middle Ages. It can cut through any substance as well as deflect energy and penetrate energy fields, including those of mystical forces. Its owner could also transport the Blade to him through a magical bond. The Ebony Blade was also enchanted with a “blood curse,” so that, should its wielder use the blade in an unworthy manner to kill, he would be overwhelmingly compelled to use the sword to spill more blood. Once, Whitman believed the curse to be lifted, but his former apprentice Sean Dolan has since succumbed to it, becoming the murderous Bloodwraith under the Blade's influence. |||| |||| Dane's original weapon was his power lance, a device adapted from the designs of his criminal uncle; it was a lance outfitted with a variety of hidden weapons, including heat beams, force beam projectors, gas emitters and bolas that could enwrap opponents. He has very seldom used the lance since adopting his various swords. |||| |||| His laser sword, also known as his neural sword or photonic sword, is a hand-held device that generates a 'blade' of light; this blade could be adjusted to various settings, including a penetrating laser that could cut through almost anything and an immaterial energy column that could disrupt a victim's nervous system without doing physical damage. |||| |||| Paraphernalia |||| When Dane Whitman touches his mystic pendant and invokes the name of Avalon, he conjures up his equipment and steed. The armor and weapons are extremely lightweight but supernaturally durable. His Shield of Night not only protects him from most attacks but also absorbs the energy of the forces directed against it. He can then release that stored energy in the form of power blasts from his blade, the Sword of Light. Strider can fly at great speeds and is even capable of travel underwater. While riding Strider, Dane is magically able to breathe regardless of his environment. |||| |||| Before acquiring Strider, Dane rode Aragorn, Valinor and an atomic steed. Aragorn is a horse whom Dane gave wings and the power of flight through genetic engineering techniques created by his criminal uncle. When Dane's first time trip to the era of the Crusades separated him from Aragorn, the horse was adopted by another adventurer, Brunnhilde the Valkyrie. Aragorn remains in Valkyrie's custody to this day, with Dane's blessing. During his time in the Twelfth Century, Dane adopted a mystical winged horse named Valinor. Unfortunately, Valinor was stolen away by the Bloodwraith. For a time, Dane used an atomic steed, one of the mechanical flying vehicles of the High Evolutionary's Knights of Wundagore. He has since abandoned it, though, and left it in storage at Avengers Mansion, where it was used by the Swordsman (Jacques Duquesne).",,"Nephew of the villainous Black Knight that went by the name of Nathan Garrett, Dane was summoned by his uncle when he was mortally wounded following a battle with Iron Man. With his last words his uncle confessed to his life of crime, and bid Dane to restore the honor of the Black Knight legacy. |||| |||| At first, Dane hoped to use merely his scientific expertise to be a force for good. However, his scientific experiments using magnetism to search for extraterrestrial life inadvertently brought Magneto and Toad back to Earth during a time when the mutant villains were believed lost in space. Magneto immediately began to re-form his Brotherhood, starting by kidnapping Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. Whitman donned the costume and weapons of the Black Knight to track Magneto down but was confronted by the Avengers, who assumed him to be his uncle. The Black Knight helped the Avengers get on the right track but parted company with them, annoyed by their distrust. |||| |||| Nathan Garrett was posthumously contacted to join the Masters of Evil organized by the Crimson Cowl (actually, the robot Ultron, who was unaware of the villainous Knight's demise.) Whitman agreed to join the team with the hopes of infiltrating their ranks, and he tried to contact the Avengers before the attack. However, Ultron guessed at Whitman’s treachery, and the Masters intercepted him, beating him and leaving him abandoned. The Black Knight happened upon the discarded Jarvis, who was also abandoned by the Masters after being set-up to appear as if he were the Crimson Cowl. The Black Knight tracked down the Masters of Evil, helping the Avengers escape and overcome their foes. The heroes then parted on better terms, although Whitman still wanted to keep his distance. |||| |||| Whitman traveled to England hoping to sell the last of his inheritance from his uncle - Garrett Castle. There, he was contacted by the spirit of his ancestor Sir Percy of Scandia, the original Black Knight, in a similar way that his uncle had. However, in this case, Whitman proved worthy of pulling the Ebony Blade out of its scabbard. With it, he defeated the demonic guardian of the sword and, afterward, Le Sabre, a modern-day agent of Sir Percy's enemy, Mordred. |||| |||| Returning to America, the Black Knight met Doctor Strange through their mutual contact of Victoria Bentley. The two began working together, once against Tiboro and once, with the Avengers, against Surtur and Ymir. |||| |||| He encountered the Avengers again when they used as pawns by Kang in playing a game with the Grandmaster and his Squadron Sinister. His Ebony Blade was the prize in a contest between Goliath (Clint Barton) and the Whizzer, but by trying to help Goliath, the Black Knight interfered with the game and the Avengers, with his Ebony Blade, were returned to Kang's future. Thanks to the mystic properties of the sword, the Black Knight was able to transport himself to it, despite the distance of space and time. He helped the heroes escape and confront Kang, who demanded power from the Grandmaster to defeat the Avengers. Ultimately, it was the Black Knight, since he was not an Avenger, who managed to strike Kang down and allow them to return to the present. In gratitude, the Avengers extended an offer of membership, and Whitman accepted, although he opted for reserve status since he resided in England at the time in Garrett Castle. |||| |||| Over time, Whitman began feeling the curse of the Ebony Blade making him grow more violent, more bloodthirsty. When he nearly killed two jewel thieves after a pursuit, he sought to end the curse by destroying the blade. The search brought him to the magical dimension of Polemachus, but he was captured by Arkon and his erstwhile ally, the Enchantress. The Enchantress placed the Black Knight under a spell, keeping him in thrall even when the Avengers, warned of the Knight's fate by the Scarlet Witch's dream, came to rescue him. The Enchantress urged Arkon to battle the Avengers in hopes they would be destroyed, but the Black Knight lost his sword during the fight, and it fell into a magical well and was seemingly destroyed. Convinced of the truth, Arkon abandoned the Enchantress and the fight, allowing the Avengers and the Knight to return home. |||| |||| In fact, the blade was not destroyed but was lost in time, appearing in Olympus. Ares discovered it and, allying with the Enchantress who was following the blade, launched an assault upon Olympus. The Black Knight learned of this through the Brazier of Truth, and assembled the Avengers to storm the halls of Olympus. Ultimately, the Avengers were successful in stopping Ares’ rampage, recovering the Ebony Blade, and remanding the Enchantress to Zeus. She soon escaped, however, and sought out the Black Knight to use as her pawn, once more placing him under her spell with a kiss. They traveled to the dimension ruled by Casiolena, and the Enchantress sought revenge against her and the Executioner, who deserted her for Casiolena. The Defenders took refuge at Garrett Castle after rescuing Barbara Norriss from the Nameless One, and inadvertently stumbled into Casiolena’s dimension. The Enchantress transformed Barbara Norriss into the Valkyrie in order to aid her cause, and the Defenders were forced into battle as well. When Casiolena was defeated, the Enchantress and Executioner fled, but not before the witch cast the Black Knight aside, transforming him into stone. During this time, Valkyrie used his winged horse, Aragorn. |||| |||| Doctor Strange took the Black Knight's body with him to his Sanctum Sanctorum, hoping to someday reverse the curse. Eventually, Strange managed to contact the Black Knight’s spirit, lost in a nameless dimension, but the message was warped by Dormammu to force the Defenders and the Avengers to compete for the Evil Eye, a powerful mystic object that Strange was led to believe would be the Knight’s only salvation. In fact, Dormammu succeeded in using the Eye to nearly destroy the universe before being defeated, and the Eye couldn’t help the Black Knight, as his spirit had traveled to the Twelfth Century during the time of the Crusades. |||| |||| Through a spell cast at the time of Camelot's demise by Merlin, Whitman's spirit inhabited the body of his ancestor, Eobar Garrington, also known as the Black Knight. Whitman was thus able to try to track down Modred the Evil, the man who murdered Garrington. Modred had died centuries before but lived on as his spirit survived in the Twelfth Century, throwing events into chaos. Merlin's spell also brought the Defenders, who helped the Knight confront Modred, his allies, and his armies. Ultimately, Whitman decided to stay in the past, fighting in the Crusades on behalf of King Richard, and the Defenders returned home. |||| |||| At some point following the Crusades, the Black Knight joined the High Druid of Avalon, Amergin, in defending the realm of Avalon from attack by the Fomor, ancestral enemies of the English gods who wished to use Avalon to invade Earth. At the Knight's suggestion, Amergin used his modern-day descendant, Doctor Druid, to elicit the Avengers' aid. They hoped to use the Evil Eye to absorb enough energy to close the portal between Avalon and Earth, but it was the Black Knight who was forced to use the Eye, destroying his body in the process. Doctor Druid returned the Avengers to present-day Earth, and with his last vestiges of power, restored the stone body of Dane Whitman and transformed him back into flesh. He soon found a new steed in the winged horse, Valinor. |||| |||| The Black Knight tried to settle back into modern-day life, although much had changed in his absence. Victoria Bentley became the caretaker of Garrett Castle, purchasing it herself during Dane's years in the Crusades to prevent the British government from seizing the property for failure to pay taxes. He also took a young Irish orphan, Sean Dolan, under his wing, becoming a guardian and mentor. However, over time, Whitman began experiencing increasing madness and bloodthirstiness. Doctor Strange revealed that the Ebony Blade had been cursed by its original owner, Sir Percy of Scandia, by spilling blood when he was in possession of the blade. Doctor Strange contacted and appealed to Sir Percy's spirit, allowing it to reside in the blade, and thereby removed the curse, warning Whitman not to inflict the sword with any curses of his own. During this time, Valinor had lost his wings and was retired. |||| |||| The Black Knight returned to America, where he took on full active membership again. During this time, he began riding a mechanical 'Atomic Steed' for his mount. He also developed a romantic crush on his fellow Avenger, the Wasp, but she didn't share Dane's feelings and he was soon forced to abandon his intentions. He did, however, became romantically interested in his admirer, the female Yellowjacket. |||| |||| Sometime later, his personality seemed to grow more medieval and archaic. When the Avengers' associate, Marrina, underwent her own transformation into a huge savage sea creature resembling the mythical Leviathan, she began sinking several fleets of ships and ravaging the undersea world of Atlantis. The Avengers hunted her down, but ultimately it was her husband, the Sub-Mariner, who took Whitman's Ebony Blade from him and dealt a mortal blow to Marrina. Whitman immediately felt the effects of the blood-curse on the blade, which took the effect of slowly transforming him into a living extension of his Ebony Blade. As such, he began to cut the people and objects he touched and gradually found it harder to move. |||| |||| The Black Knight was forced to leave the Avengers in the company of his teammate Thor, who hoped to find a cure for Whitman's condition in the realm of Asgard. However, at the time Asgard became embroiled in a battle against the Egyptian death god Seth and his army. Ultimately, Thor used the Knight's cursed, blade-like body to kill Seth. Thor then took the Knight’s body back to Earth, placing it in the care of Doctor Strange. Dane Whitman was restored to normal through the combined efforts of Doctor Strange, his friends Victoria Bentley and Sean Dolan, and the spirit of Sir Percy. |||| |||| The Black Knight soon returned to the Avengers, having abandoned his Ebony Blade in favor of a high-tech laser sword. More determined and driven than before, the Knight grew into one of the Avengers' most prominent members, even serving as unofficial field leader under the Black Widow. His drive in the Avengers led him to become more ruthless than before, even to the point of advocating the assassination of the alien Supreme Intelligence for its role in sparking war between the Kree and Shi'ar alien races. Also, Whitman began neglecting Valinor, his squire Dolan, and his benefactor Victoria Bentley. |||| |||| Sean Dolan later used the Ebony Blade, becoming possessed by it and being transformed into the demonic Bloodwraith, killing Victoria Bentley and stealing Valinor for himself. More poignantly, Whitman and Bentley had just begun to entertain a potential romance before her death. Dane defeated the Bloodwraith, but Dolan escaped, becoming one of Whitman's most bitter foes. |||| |||| The Black Knight soon found himself in a love triangle involving himself and two of his teammates, the Inhuman, Crystal, and the Eternal, Sersi. Dane was in love with Crystal, the estranged wife of Quicksilver, but was also strongly attracted to the mentally unstable Sersi, who was madly in love with him and forced Dane to mentally bond with her. When Quicksilver returned to the group and seemed prepared to reconcile with Crystal, Dane unselfishly renounced his feelings for her. About the same time, the Avengers were attacked by Whitman's counterpart from another dimension, the Proctor, who was determined to kill Sersi in revenge for what her counterpart had done to him, including the mental-bonding process. The Black Knight helped defeat the Proctor and resigned himself to accompany Sersi in her exile to another dimension as her growing mental instability made her too dangerous to remain on Earth. |||| |||| During their adventures in other dimensions, Sersi regained her emotional stability and Dane spent some time with a super-team called Ultraforce, even becoming its leader. He and Sersi eventually decided to return to their own Earth, though, and managed to do so after an accidental side trip to the Crusades, during which Dane earned the friendship and enmity of Bennet du Paris, a power-mad knight who survived into modern times as the mutant terrorist Exodus, leader of the Acolytes. On returning to present-day Earth, Dane and Sersi split up. The Avengers were temporarily disbanded at the time, so the Black Knight found a new home and new employment at Oracle Incorporated, joining the company's new super-team, Heroes for Hire. At about the same time, Dane was contacted by the Lady of the Lake, who informed him that he was fated to be the champion of Avalon, the mystical Celtic realm the Black Knight had been allied with during his time in the Twelfth Century. The Lady of the Lake gave the Knight a new magical winged steed and mystical weapons to better battle evil in Avalon's name. |||| |||| The Black Knight continued to battle evil as a member of Heroes for Hire and as an inactive member of the Avengers, until Heroes for Hire's disbanding. In one of the team's final missions, they encountered on Mt. Wundagore the humanoid animals created by the High Evolutionary. The Black Knight elected to stay on Wundagore to lead these 'New Men' as the Knights of Wundagore. |||| |||| The Black Knight later broke away from the New Men in order to join his fellow Avengers in various adventures. One such adventure brought the Black Knight to the country of Slorenia, where the Bloodwraith was ravaging the land. The Knight hoped to remain near Slorenia to finally defeat the Bloodwraith, but he rejoined the Avengers during their war against Kang, who nearly succeeded in conquering Earth. The Black Knight parted company with the Avengers yet again after the battle with Kang was over."

This power, though, is more magical than scientific, owing to its origin from the Starheart, which also powers her father's Green Lantern ring. She had a telepathic link to her brother, Obsidian. |||| |||| When she lost her primary power after a battle with the Starheart itself, she derived a similar power from a Green Lantern Corps ring, making her briefly, technically, a Corps member. |||| |||| In the modern era, most of her original power set has returned, meaning that her Green Lantern-like powers are ones she produces without the assistance of a ring or other object. |||| |||| In addition to these super powers, she's also endowed with innate leadership skills, with which she has guided the Outsiders and various other groups.",,"She was very briefly the GL for Earth's sector, serving in Kyle Rayner's absence when previous Green Lanterns of Earth refused the ring when Kyle left Earth to restart the Green Lantern Corps.  Her first appearance in this capacity was Green Lantern (1990) #107. |||| |||| At the time, she had lost her natural powers, which are essentially those of a Green Lantern Corps power ring, though they emanate from her own body.

1736,Fin Fang Foom (Marvel),,1736_20060522135327_char.jpg,"As a member of a race of aliens known as Makluans or Kakaranatharans, Fin Fang Foom possesses superhuman strength, the ability to fly via his wings at supersonic speeds, and can spew combustible acid mist from his mouth (making him appear to 'breathe fire'). The dragon is also extremely durable and can regenerate at a rapid rate. By entering into long periods of hibernation, Fin Fang Foom has managed to survive for centuries. Fin Fang Foom is also a shape-shifter who can change size and shape to appear either as a human being or as a dragon far larger than a normal Kakaranatharan. He possesses a gifted intellect, and can communicate telepathically. He is 44 feet long, including his tail, and weighs 2 tons in his normal state. |||| |||| Fin Fang Foom has a vulnerability to an unnamed herb which can induce slumber. |||| |||| He excels in hand to hand combat, and is a master of the martial arts of the planet Kakaranathara. He uses a Makluan starship built by the technicians of Kakaranathara, for interstellar transportation.",,"Although once believed to be a native of the Valley of the Sleeping Dragon in China, the creature later known as Fin Fang Foom is an alien being from the world of Kakaranathara (also known as Maklu IV) in the Maklu system of the Greater Magellanic Cloud. The alien and several other members of his race originally depart from their peaceful home-world with the intention of conquering other planets. The alien, as a member of the starship's crew, serves as the navigator. The alien dragons land on Earth in ancient China, and the crew used their natural shape-shifting powers to mimic human form, intent on entering and studying human society before beginning their conquest. The alien navigator was the exception, and acting as reserve is placed in a tomb and given an herb that places him in a catatonic state. |||| |||| The alien is briefly awakened in the 8th Century, where he is given the name Fin Fang Foom and called a 'dragon' due to his species' resemblance to mythological Asian dragons, and returns to sleep with a second application of the herb. Foom sleeps until the modern age, when he is deliberately awakened by teenager Chan Liuchow, whose homeland is under threat from invading forces of the Communist Party of China. Liuchow taunts Foom with the threat of the herb, and goads the dragon into chasing him straight into the Communist camp, which Foom decimates. Liuchow subsequently leads him back into his tomb, where the herb returns Foom to his sleep. At some point, the sleeping Fin Fang Foom is captured by the Elder of the Universe known as the Collector, and imprisoned in his subterranean collection of monsters. When the Mole Man attacks the facility, Foom and the other monsters escape  and are later captured by the recently-formed Fantastic Four and deposited on Monster Isle. Foom, however, has no desire to serve the Mole Man (who uses the island as a base) and leaves, returning to China and hibernation. |||| |||| Sometime later a scientist called Doctor Vault manages to mentally control the dragon and attack Vault's foe It the Living Colossus. Resisting the control, Foom instead aids the Colossus against an alien invasion - intent on preserving the planet for the dragon's own race to conquer at a later date. Vault's mind control briefly forces Foom to battle the Colossus; Foom overpowers his opponent with martial arts before freeing his mind and returning to hibernation yet again. |||| |||| Years later, Fin Fang Foom is again roused from his slumber when his body is possessed by the demon Aan Taanu. Combating a group of occult adventurers (including an older Chan Liuchow, now a Professor) known as the Legion of Night in New York, Taanu is exorcised from Foom's body, and the confused Foom once again returns to hibernation. |||| |||| At some point in the modern age the Makluan vessel is found by a man who steals ten sophisticated rings from it, and eventually becomes the supervillain the Mandarin. |||| |||| Years later the Mandarin is directed to the Valley of the Sleeping Dragon by the captain of the vessel - in human guise - and finds and wakes Fin Fang Foom, using the dragon to threaten the Chinese government. Foom helps the Mandarin take control of one third of China. He is then revealed as an alien of Kakaranathara, and with fellow alien 'Chen Hsu,' he begins to summon his fellow 'dragons' who had been disguised as humans for centuries. When the other Makluans shed their human forms to begin their conquest, the Mandarin realizes he is being used and joins forces with the superheroes Iron Man and War Machine to defeat the dragons, the battle ending with their apparent annihilation. |||| |||| Although Fin Fang Foom's body is destroyed, his spirit survives and bonds itself to a small dragon statue, which was stolen from a curio shop by teenager Billy Yuan at Foom's mental urging. Using Yuan's body as a conduit for his power, Foom summons thousands of lizards from the sewers beneath New York, merging them with Yuan's body to recreate his own form. Iron Man, however, defeats Foom once again, with assistance from the last remnants of Yuan's mind. Due to several legal complications, however, the defeated dragon is sent to Monster Isle again, where he and several other monsters go on to briefly battle the dimensionally-displaced Justice League of America. |||| |||| Tired of the constant defeats and with the other members of the Makluan crew dead, Foom decides to reform and becomes a follower of Buddhism. He enters into a rehabilitation program, which sees himself and three other monsters - the robot Elektro, the giant ape Gorgilla and the alien Googam - shrunk down to human size, hypnotically stripped of their powers, and allowed to enter human society. Taking up a job as head chef in a Chinese restaurant within the Baxter Building, Foom teams up with the other monsters to defeat the size-changing warlord Tim Boo Baa as the 'Fin Fang Four.' |||| |||| Foom later appears as a pawn of the Beyond Corporation©, and while having reverted back to its' original size, lacks any real intelligence. Foom is eventually defeated by Aaron Stack, who allows himself to be swallowed by the dragon and then eviscerates it internally.  'Fin Fang Four' writer Roger Langridge notes that if given the opportunity to do a further Fin Fang Foom story, he would explain that the Beyond Corporation's Foom was merely a clone of Foom made when intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D. took a sample of his DNA years ago. |||| |||| Fin Fang Foom later reappears, still in shrunken form, and begrudgingly aids Wong - the servant of Dr. Strange - in defeating a force of HYDRA agents."

Using a fuel made of the same meteoric materials that Reed Richards used to create his, Ivan launched a spaceship at the precise time that the Fantastic Four launched their own into space. Ivan crewed his ship with a trio of apes that he had trained to operate the ship, repair its machinery, and fire weapons, which he kept under-fed so that they would continue to obey him. And because Ivan had spent time researching the Fantastic Four, he was prepared for the cosmic rays he would encounter along the way, though unlike the four heroes, Ivan constructed his spaceship out of transparent, ceramic plastic to allow as much of the cosmic rays to filter through as possible. So that once he had reached space, Ivan and his three apes were bombarded by an intense dose of the rays, more than the Fantastic Four before them. Ivan’s Gorilla became super-strong; his orangutan gained control of magnetism; and the baboon gained the ability to transform into other objects at will. Ivan Kragoff, himself, became the Red Ghost, with the power to make his body insubstantial, allowing him to pass through solid objects. |||| |||| |||| Once the Red Ghost and his Super Apes reached the Blue Area of the Moon, they found an abandoned city as well as a more modern, inhabited dwelling. They also found the Fantastic Four’s Thing, and fought with him until Uatu The Watcher appeared and stopped the apes and the two combatants. He explained that his species observed others, but never interfered. However, Earth was becoming dangerously close to a devastating clash between the United States and Russia, which might reduce the human race to savagery and barbarism. He also announced that the Red Ghost and the Fantastic Four must fight to decide the battle. |||| |||| |||| The Red Ghost and his Apes fought the Fantastic Four until Reed designed a paralyzing ray that enabled him to freeze the Red Ghost who could not otherwise be touched. Then, while the Watcher explained that he would have to move his base to a new place, now that humans were capable of traveling to the moon, the Red Ghost’s gorilla released him from his paralysis. But when the Red Ghost tried to control them, after the Invisible Girl had fed them, they turned on him and chased him across the moon. |||| |||| |||| He returned many times after, using his apes to fight the Fantastic Four. At one time he tried to strand the Fantastic Four on the Moon, but they escaped to the Blue Area and soon fought back, knocking the Red Ghost into a portal and returning home. The Red Ghost was also one of the villains that Doctor Doom used to disrupt Reed and Sue's wedding. He attacked Susan and Alicia Masters, but Doctor Strange appeared and used his powers to send him to a distant nether world."

For a time, the Sensei was possessed by the spirit called Jonah, who in Sensei's body was responsible for the murder of Boston Brand, who became Deadman after his death. After a struggle with Deadman and Rama Kushna, Jonah was destroyed and the Sensei resumed control of his body. For a brief time, the Sensei assumed leadership of the League of Assassins. |||| |||| By this stage The Sensei was clearly insane (if he had not been before) with no goals other than to raise assassination to an artform. Among other crimes he used Bronze Tiger, the brainwashed partner of Richard Dragon, to carry out a number of assassinations. Most notably used The Bronze Tiger to occupy Batman in battle, while other assassins killed Batman's friend Kathy Kane. |||| |||| He next attempted to kill a number of dignitiaries by having the League plant explosives along a fault line, stating that using a force of nature to carry out an assassination would be his greatest work of art. Although Batman arrived in time to rescue the deligates, he was unable to stop the earthquake. With no time to pursue The Sensei himself, Batman was forced to allow Ra's al Ghul to go after the assassin. Sensei then engaged himself in a fight to the death with Ra's al Ghul, during which both of them were swallowed by the earthquake. Ra's lived thanks to his rejuvenating Lazarus Pit.

She had sent a small band of her most trusted aides to Sanctuary II to repair its hyper-drive engines and teleport the station out of the solar system, but the activity coincided with the arrival of the hero Monica Rambeau (as Captain Marvel), who had been sent to investigate the craft by her team the Avengers. Nebula's minions warped the satellite out of the solar system with Captain Marvel aboard and rendezvoused with Nebula. |||| Nebula hoped to conquer the Skrull empire, at the time in the throes of chaos as their throneworld was destroyed by the planet-destroyer Galactus. Not knowing how to return home, Captain Marvel pretended to go along with Nebula's scheme but actually helped the Skrulls evacuate the outpost world Nebula was intent on destroying. The Avengers eventually located their missing member and allied themselves with the Skrulls to oppose her. Before the Avengers were able to catch up with Nebula, she annihilated both the Skrull outpost and the planet Xandar, home planet of the Avengers' ally Firelord. In battle with Nebula, the Avengers’ Starfox, brother of Thanos, learned that Nebula claimed to be Thanos' granddaughter, and thus his great-niece. Shortly thereafter, the virtually omnipotent Beyonder, curious about the Avengers, arrived, and in an attempt to help the Avengers vanquish Nebula, helped her and her minions to escape them by teleportlng them out of the Andromeda Galaxy. |||| |||| Nebula was later summoned to the side of Thanos, who had at the time assembled the Infinity Gems to create the Infinity Gauntlet and thereby give himself omnipotent power. Thanos scoffed at Nebula's claims to be his granddaughter, and as a gift to the embodiment of Death, transformed her into a hideous 'living sculpture' of pain and living death. Unfortunately for Thanos, he allowed himself to be distracted by an assemblage of the universe's heroes and thus failed to notice Nebula until she stole the Infinity Gauntlet for herself. Now omnipotent herself, she faced an entourage of cosmic beings that included Galactus, Master Order, and Lord Chaos. Soon, however, the original Soul Gem owner, Adam Warlock, subverted the Infinity Gauntlet for himself. Starfox elected to take Nebula into custody of the Eternals on the moon Titan. |||| |||| Somehow, under circumstances to be revealed, Nebula escaped and resumed her piracy career with her crew. They infiltrated a device known as the Infinity Union from the planet of the enigmatic alien Stranger.

The Atomic Compressor succeeded in negating all of reality, which led her into conflict with the Avengers once again. |||| |||| The Avengers, with their ally Spider-Man, defeated and captured the space pirate Nebula but an enraged Stranger burst in, searching for the Infinity Union, which had since absorbed the energies created from the negation of reality. Fearing that neither the Stranger nor anyone else was worthy of wielding such a dangerous device, the Avengers decide to track down the Infinity Union themselves. An increasingly unnerved Spider-Man, unaccustomed to dealing with cosmic menaces, found the device first-- and then accidentally set it off. Nebula had arranged to absorb the power of the Infinity Union and become a supreme being. The Avengers and the Stranger managed to thwart her regardless, stripping her of the Infinity Union's power, though Nebula managed to escape capture with her crewman Gunthar. |||| |||| Nebula's next appearance was a sudden attack on the young hero Nova. Nebula claimed that Nova had previously murdered her father Zorr, an archemeny of Nova Prime, the hero of Xandar whose powers Nova had inherited.

She has a mystical link to the lands and peoples of Costa Verde, though the limits of this connection are as yet unexplored.",,"The Kamekeri are a small South American tribe located in Costa Verde. Originally part of the Tahuantinsuyu, they worshipped both the Incan and their own local gods until missionaries convinced them to reject their old beliefs for modern ways. However, Peliali, the Volcano Goddess, swore never to leave her home or her people. Though the Kamekeri kept in touch with the outside world the Costa Verde government officially learned of their existence only recently. |||| |||| Years ago Jamie Santiago returned from one of many journeys into the Andes with an infant girl he claimed was his by Peliali. Revealed as a shape-shifter at her christening, Lupe grew up teased by other children. When her father died, Lupe was taken in by the Church orphanage, despite their misgivings about her “ungodly” powers. When a TV ad brought the orphanage a letter from Edwin Jarvis they decided to make Lupe his sponsor, believing that his connections to Iron Man might be able to help her someday. Lupe began a correspondence with Jarvis that lasted several years, though not revealing her birthright. Agents of Moses Magnum learned of her powers while traveling to America and forced her to fight the Avengers while they stole a seismic cannon being shipped through JFK Airport. Lupe cooperated on the condition that no hostages or bystanders were killed. Once Magnum Force escaped, Lupe, now called Silverclaw, helped the Avengers retrieve the cannon. |||| |||| Lupe attended college classes until a telegram warned her of an old Costa Verde prophecy coming true. Once Silverclaw and the Avengers arrived they discovered that sorcerer Kulan Gath had transformed the Kamekeri into Hyborian Era (circa 10, 000 B.C.) versions of themselves and was intending to sacrifice Peliali in order to attain godhood and destroy the Earth. The Avengers were able to distract Gath long enough for Silverclaw to channel the belief of the Kamekeri into Peliali allowing her to escape and leaving Gath to the mercy of his demonic masters. |||| |||| Now an Avenger reservist, Silverclaw continued her studies while helping out against such foes as Ronan the Accuser, a homunculus of Estaban Diablo, and Kang. When the Avengers helped Mantis save her son Sequoia from one of the Thanosi (renegade Thanos duplicates), Silverclaw was attracted to the extra-dimensional Haywire, but his obsession with reviving his dead girlfriend Inertia ultimately destroyed him. Silverclaw also aided the Avengers when an extra-dimensional madman tried to merge their universe with his own and when an insane Scarlet Witch attempted to destroy the Avengers."

Once reborn, she could fire powerful energy blasts, form energy fields, communicate directly with cosmic beings such as Eternity and Death, and gained complete control of her personal energies as well as her physical form. Her mind, a human/plant hybrid, is largely immune to mental or metaphysical assault, and her physical durability is greatly enhanced. She can achieve a meditative state in which she is largely immune to physical, mental or spiritual harm. She also seems to have limited powers of flight, though it is possible these function only in the vacuum of space. |||| |||| Through training with the Priests of Pama, Mantis attained 'complete control' over her body, achieving peak human agility, the ability to accelerate her recuperative powers through force of will, and an empathic nature enabling her to sense the emotions of others as 'psychic vibrations.' Her mastery of the Priests' martial arts, which focus on manipulation of nerve endings and pressure points, has enabled her to knock out beings as powerful as Thor.",,"The enigmatic Mantis traces her roots back to the family of Vietnamese crimelord Monsieur Khruul who, disapproving of his sister Lua's marriage to German mercenary Gustav Brandt, hunted the couple across Indochina. The Brandts eluded him while Lua bore a child, but Khruul ultimately had their house burned to the ground, killing Lua and blinding Gustav, who fled with their infant daughter. They found sanctuary in the temple of the Priests of Pama, renegade pacifist members of the alien Kree race who were caretakers of the Cotati, a telepathic race of sentient plants. The Priests trained Gustav, granting him psychic sight, but separated him from his daughter, not wanting his violent nature to influence her development. Brandt eventually left the Temple, later joining the crime cartel Zodiac as Libra. |||| |||| Believing Mantis might grow to be the Celestial Madonna and mother the genetically perfect Celestial Messiah, the Priests of Pama trained Mantis in their martial arts, which she mastered, and gave her the name 'Mantis,' in recognition of her skill in defeating male opponents. They also taught her telepathic communication with the Cotati, which gave her empathic abilities. On Mantis' eighteenth birthday, the Priests removed Mantis' memories, implanting false memories of an orphaned life in Ho Chi Minh City, and sent her to experience life among normal humans. Meanwhile, the Shao-Lom monks of Titan, whose teachings also stemmed from the pacifist Kree's beliefs, mentored another possible Celestial Madonna: Earth-born orphan Heather Douglas, later known as Moondragon, but her sheltered life denied her insight into human existence, making her a less-rounded candidate. Moondragon would eventually return to Earth, becoming involved with the Avengers. |||| |||| As a bar girl coincidentally employed by her unwitting uncle, Monsieur Khruul, Mantis met the Swordsman (Jacques Duquesne), an adventurer turned alcoholic mercenary who worked for Khruul. Sensing a spark of nobility in the Swordsman and seeking a better life for herself, Mantis romanced and rehabilitated Duquesne, convincing him to return to America and rejoin the Avengers. She accompanied him, but had difficulty gaining the Avengers' trust after she deceived them, single-handedly taking down both Thor and Captain America as part of her plan to help the Avengers defeat the Lion God. Still, her abilities served the Avengers well; she aided the team during its Loki/Dormammu-masterminded Avengers-Defenders War; and against foes including the Collector, Klaw, and Ultron. Her empathic abilities helped save the universe when she deduced how Captain Mar-Vell could defeat the Cosmic Cube-empowered Thanos. |||| |||| During her association with the Avengers, Mantis became disenchanted with the Swordsman and began a slow seduction of the Vision, which further damaged Mantis' standing with the team. When the Avengers fought and defeated Zodiac, Libra was captured and revealed his identity as Mantis' father, telling her some portion of her history. Returning to the Pama temple, Mantis found the Priests slain by her uncle, who was in turn slain by the Star-Stalker, who had been kept imprisoned by the Priests. Though she still lacked her true memories, Mantis began doubting what she'd believed. |||| |||| Knowing the Celestial Madonna to be among them and hoping to father the Celestial Messiah himself, Kang attacked the Avengers. Defeated, he identified Mantis as the Celestial Madonna and attempted to kill her, but the Swordsman took the blast himself and died. Mantis, guilt-ridden and grief-stricken, buried the Swordsman in the garden of the Priests of Pama; however, the eldest Cotati reanimated the Swordsman's body and confirmed that Mantis was the Celestial Madonna. Immortus, Libra and the Cotati revealed the full history of Mantis, who accepted her destiny as the Celestial Madonna (to Moondragon's irritation). In a ceremony conducted by Immortus, Mantis and the Eldest Cotati wed (as did the Scarlet Witch and the Vision), after which the celestial couple transformed into energy and departed Earth. Before she departed, the Avengers declared Mantis an official member of their ranks. |||| |||| Merged with the Cotati's essence, Mantis gained Cotati abilities as well as her own, and began to evolve into 'the essence of life,' a change which physically manifested as a greenish hue in her skin. Conceiving the future Celestial Messiah, she left our universe, but even in other universes she found herself pursued -- on one alternate Earth she was aided by a league of justice-serving heroes against a mechanical construct which sought to prevent her child's birth. Eventually her son, Sequoia, was born, and Mantis attempted to raise him as normally as possible in the town of Willimantic, Connecticut. Dark forces rose against her, attempting to create an evil counterpart to her child, but she aided those who fought them; nothing eclipsed her attempts to raise the boy peacefully. |||| |||| When the fast-growing child reached an age when the Cotati race chose to parent him alone, Mantis again took to the stars, where she uncovered a plot by the Elders of the Universe to acquire the six Infinity Gems and destroy Galactus. Fearing this would destroy reality, Mantis located the Silver Surfer and traveled with him as he fought the Elders, bonding romantically with him. When the Gardener attacked her using the Soul Gem, she barely escaped and transferred herself to Shalla-Bal, the Surfer's former beloved on his homeworld. She and Shalla-Bal were both subsequently captured by the Elders. When the Elders attempted to destroy them both, Mantis sacrificed herself, allowing the Surfer to rescue Shalla-Bal. |||| |||| The power of the Elders' Infinity Gems proved too much for Mantis, who could not fully reconstruct herself, and fragments of her essence formed several 'shadow' Mantises. One shadow form awoke on Earth as an amnesiac, lacking powers. Seeking help, she aided the Avengers against the Voice and the High Evolutionary, and they in turn aided her in regaining her memories. The Fantastic Four then helped her try to return to her son, but Kang and Necrodamus interfered; after foiling them, Mantis returned to the stars as pure energy. The Silver Surfer encountered a shadow Mantis on Verdant, a plant world threatened by Galactus, and this Mantis aided the Surfer, the Fantastic Four, and the Avengers in defeating Galactus and saving the Shi'ar homeworld. Over time, most shadow Mantises ceased to exist, fading even from the memories of those they'd encountered. During the Immortus-guided conspiracy known as The Crossing, the Avengers fought a Mantis seemingly allied with Kang, but this Mantis was ultimately revealed to be a Space Phantom, with no relation to either the true Mantis or her 'shadows.' |||| |||| Over time, the true Mantis began to recover as her scattered essence coalesced into five forms, each reflecting an aspect of her personality: freak, mother, lover, mystic, and Avenger. Thanos, a self-proclaimed god of death disturbed by the emergence of the Celestial Messiah and the Celestial Madonna as supposed deities of life, began killing fragmentary Mantises, unwittingly hastening the re-formation of the true Mantis, who was reborn as 'the goddess of life.' Fully restored, she teamed with the Avengers and the Squadron Supreme's Haywire to seek out Sequoia and defend him from Thanos, ultimately fighting beside Thanos to neutralize the reality-devouring Rot (though Thanos later claimed it was one of his Thanosi 'clones' who encountered Mantis). Mantis offered guidance to both young Avengers recruit Silverclaw, another potential goddess, and her own son, 'Quoi,' who had become bitter and rebellious during Mantis' absence but ultimately accepted his mother and his own role as the Celestial Messiah. During the Thanos conflict, Mantis and Vision (now long-separated from the Scarlet Witch) finally became lovers, but the Vision decided his mechanical nature made him ill-suited for a relationship with the maternal Mantis because their union could not produce children, and he broke off the romance. Mantis returned to Earth and was among the Avengers who faced the deranged Scarlet Witch."
203,Iron Man (Marvel)(01 - Tony Stark),Anthony Edward 'Tony' Stark ,203_20080930102826_char.jpg,Genius-level intellect. ,Recovered alcoholic.,"A youthful prodigy, Tony Stark entered MIT at a young age and graduated with top honors.  Soon afterwards, he inherited the family company, Stark Industries, following the death of his parents.  Based upon his own cutting-edge designs, the company flourished, and he quickly amassed a considerable fortune. |||| |||| While visiting a war zone (originally Vietnam, although later stories placed it in the context of the first Gulf War), Stark was wounded and captured.  Pressed into service designing weapons for the enemy, he secretly worked to design a suit of power armor, which provided him with enhanced strength while also serving to keep him alive, protecting him from the shrapnel that had lodged in his heart.  Escaping his captors, Stark makes it back to American lines, rescuing a wounded US Air Force pilot, Jim Rhodes, along the way. |||| |||| After returning to the States, Stark begins to improve his armor designs, setting up the Iron Man alter-ego as his bodyguard while he begins his career as a superhero.  A founding member of the Avengers, Stark provides much of the material and technical support for the group, concealing his dual role as a member of the group even from the others.  As time goes by, however, Stark's personal life begins to threaten his career as Iron Man.  A dependency on alcohol leads to difficulties maintaining his business interests, problems exacerbated by attacks from business rivals Justin Hammer and Obadiah Stane.  Eventually, Stane's actions lead Stark to fall deeper into alcoholism, and he actually loses his company;  at the same time, James Rhodes, now a long-time friend, takes over the role of Iron Man.  Eventually, Stark is able to regain both his corporation and fortune, along with the use of the Iron Man identity, replacing a mentally unstable Rhodes and defeating Stane in combat. |||| |||| Having sworn to leave the business of arms manufacture, Stark moves proactively against uses of his armor technology for aggressive purposes, disarming both heroes and villains, and going so far as to oppose government and law enforcement groups.  Later, following health problems, he fakes his own death and places himself in suspended animation, while Rhodes again takes the Iron Man role, this time in the armored suit known as War Machine.  Although Stark does eventually recover, his deception alienates him from Rhodes. |||| |||| Following a conflict with his own temporarily sentient armor, Stark's heart is replaced with an artificial organ, fixing many of his health problems, but leading him to require periodic charging, just as in the earliest days of his armored breastplate.  Later on, he publicly reveals his identity as Iron Man, and accepts a position as Secretary of Defense, a role he fulfills through the events leading up to the Avengers being disbanded.  In the meantime, a self-administered exposure to the techno-organic Extremis virus leads to new abilities whereby he now carries certain portions of his armor control systems within his body, allowing him to control his suit remotely and interface with other electronic information systems, as well as increasing his reaction time and own ability to heal. |||| |||| Recently, Stark heads the government project to instate the Super-human Registration Act, leading to conflicts with several of his past allies.  The pro-Registration side ultimately triumphs in this struggle, and Stark is elevated to director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and head of the Initiative Project, dedicated to creating a roster of different teams, each serving as a government-trained and -licensed superhuman police force on a state-by-state basis."

1365,Quasar (Marvel)(02 - Wendell Vaughn),Wendell Elvis Vaughn ,1365_20060723063214_char.jpg,"Quasar's powers are derived from the pair of quantum bands fused to his wrists (or more specifically, from the seven gems on each of the bands). They are linked to their wearer's nervous system and grant tremendous powers of energy manipulation. |||| |||| Foremost amongst these powers is the ability to tap into a limitless energy source called the quantum zone. Quasar can project quantum energy in the form of devastating beams of force or heat, but more commonly employs them to fashion incredibly durable constructs of solid energy, such as containment spheres or pincers. He protects himself with a personal force field of quantum energy. |||| |||| The quantum bands can also exert control over many other types of energy that are part of the electromagnetic spectrum. For example, Quasar once tapped into a sun and caused it to emit an enormous solar flare. He can also absorb and redirect the cosmic energy wielded by such powerful beings as the Silver Surfer, Jack of Hearts, Adam Warlock, Thanos, Phoenix, and the Watchers, siphoning their power and using it to augment his quantum energy. Forms of energy the quantum bands cannot control include magic and darkforce. |||| |||| Although he cannot overtly affect psionic energy, Quasar has programmed his bands to render him impervious to psionic mental control. Even Moondragon and the Overmind proved unable to overcome this defense. He does not appear to be protected from magical forms of compulsion. |||| |||| Quasar can create apertures into and out of the quantum zone, thus allowing passage through its infinite, featureless expanse. He mainly uses this ability to traverse interstellar distances in a manner similar to hyperspace travel. The effect is essentially a form of teleportation, which Quasar refers to as a quantum jump. A quantum jump has a destructive side effect on the local environment, violently upheaving gravity and tearing holes in the atmosphere (on Earth, it would damage the ozone layer), so Quasar initially refrained from using it except when in space or in dire circumstances. However, he eventually realized that he could contain this side effect by first surrounding himself with a barrier of solid energy. Quasar can also shunt other matter into the quantum zone provided that he's in physical contact with it. |||| |||| The quantum bands enable their wearer to fly by manipulating gravitons. The maximum flight speed he can attain is unknown, but he made a trip from Earth to Uranus in approximately four years flying non-stop (this was before he learned how to quantum jump). That would require a constant speed of roughly 50,000 miles per hour. This doesn't take into account the velocity he can achieve in a short burst of acceleration. |||| |||| The quantum band gems seem to be able to analyze and process information as if they were extremely advanced computers. This allows Quasar to navigate the quantum zone and the depths of space. The gems are able to detect, analyze, and track energy emissions across vast distances. They can also 'program' his quantum energy to register and react to certain preset conditions. For instance, at one time Quasar had the Earth surrounded with an invisible laticework of energy that was designed to act as a global alert system against potential extraterrestrial threats. The energy field could detect any surges of exotic energy emanating from the planet's surface as well as if any object larger than a micrometeorite passed through it; in either case, the field would react by transmitting an alert signal to the quantum bands. |||| |||| Quasar has a direct link to Epoch through his bands, which gives him ready access to her nascent omniscience. |||| [edit] |||| |||| The Star Brand |||| |||| While he possessed the power of the Star Brand, Quasar gained the abilities of flight, superhuman strength and resilience. He also was able to regenerate his entire body from minute remains and did not need to eat, drink, or breathe. However, virtually all of the energy derived from the Star Brand was depleted not long after he gave it away. The Living Tribunal later stated that Quasar's body retains only an insignificant trace amount of energy. |||| [edit] |||| |||| Cosmic awareness |||| |||| Quasar also briefly possessed the same powers of cosmic awareness that Eon granted to the origial Captain Marvel. By simply concentrating for a moment, he could gain complete knowledge about virtually anything in the universe. It's unclear why Eon didn't bestow cosmic awareness on Quasar permanently, but being nigh-omniscient himself, he likely determined that it would have been detrimental to Quasar's psyche (as it was to that of Genis-Vell). The fact that he received the awareness while his mind was inhabiting an energy construct, and he did not demonstrate it upon returning to his body, may also have something to do with it. |||| |||| From the Wikipedia entry for Quasar |||| http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar_(comics) |||| ||||",,None entered.

Thor was born centuries ago in a cave in Norway. Once Thor was weened, Odin brought him to Asgard where he was raised to be the God of Thunder and heir to the throne. As the Asgardian God of Thunder, Thor commands the thunder, the lightning the wind and all the elements of the storm with his hammer Mjolnir, which was forged from the legendary, indestructible Asgardian metal; Uru. Mjolnir gives Thor the power of flight and helps him channel, focus or amplify his own godly elemental powers. Though the hammer is quite heavy by mortal standards, It can only be lifted by those deemed worthy to do so, regardless of the would-be wielder’s physical strength. After centuries of defending Asgard from its enemies, Thor became too proud and grew headstrong. It was because of this that he was banished to Midgard (Earth) by his father to teach him some needed humility. Made mortal and given the form of the handicapped human doctor Donald Blake, Thor learned what it was like to be small and frail and how to be humble and truly noble despite being mortal. When in his mortal guise of Dr. Blake he is able to transform into his true godly form by striking his walking stick (actually Mjolnir in disguise) upon any solid surface causing the transformation that changes him into Thor and his walking stick into his hammer Mjolnir.

As his story has developed, however, there appears to have been more sinister intent to his invention, as he shares DNA from both Superman and Lex Luthor. A partial clone of both men, he's fully neither.  Consequently, he doesn't have the same range of powers as Superman, nor quite the genius of Luthor. Morally, he appears to rest more on the 'good' side of the spectrum, but he does trend a little darker than Kal-El. His personality has some commonalities with the 'rebellious' Power Girl, though it, at times, seems to be a bit more of a caricature. |||| |||| The original source of his powers was a thing called 'tactile telekinesis', which allowed him to mentally manipulate anything he could touch. As his character has evolved, however, he has begun to gradually possess more traditional Kryptonian powers as well. It has been stated that this is due to the Kryptonian abilities emerging through puberty. |||| |||| Superboy would eventually carve out his own identity and join Young Justice and later the Teen Titans where he fell in love with the current Wonder Girl. During the events of the Infinite Crisis Suberboy Prime killed Connor who died in Wonder Girl’s arms. However during the events of the Final Crisis as Superman battled Superboy Prime in the future alongside the Legion of Superheroes, Brainic 5 revived Superboy who aided in the defeat of Superboy Prime and returned to the present day with Superman and Kid Flash (Bart Allen)."

Due to the unique properties of intergalactic travel, he returned to Earth almost 2,000 years later, and became a resident of Metropolis, where he would meet Superman. |||| |||| Origins |||| Added by Mrblonde267Marcus Aelius was a Roman Centurion during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (c. A.D. 117-138). A race of aliens, the Virmiru selected him to learn from their advanced civilization after he was proven as the most worthy prospective Warrior in the Olympics. After over ten years of learning from the Virmiru, he was returned to Earth, where he was supposed to act as a hero on what was then the world's biggest city. Due to the scientific properties of intergalactic travel, he actually found himself over 2,000 years in the future, and to his disappointment, the world's leading city was no longer Rome, but Metropolis. Nonetheless, he became the city's protector, in a world that did not feature a Superman. Already displaced thousands of years from his own time, the Centurion had a very public identity. |||| |||| Zero Hour |||| Main article: Zero Hour |||| The Alpha Centurion originally appeared during Zero Hour as a member of an alternate timeline.[1] He was the sole protector of Metropolis, operating out of what would regularly be LexCorp Tower, and even maintained a steady relationship with Lois Lane. In his timeline, the Metropolis Police Force was an alternate good version of the 100, still featuring such members as Maggie Sawyer and Jim Harper. He met Superman when the two of them teamed up in Centurion's Metropolis against Bloody Mary.[2] He also helped in the battle against Extant and Parallax, although the resulting temporal chaos erased him and his timeline from existence.[3] |||| |||| Regular Arrival |||| Eventually, Marcus Aelius showed up in the regular timeline.[4] There was initially tension between him and Superman (especially surrounding Centurion's feelings for Lois Lane), and the two of them were frequently at odds. The Alpha Centurion joined forces with the Contessa, who was at that time in charge of LexCorp while Lex Luthor was in hiding. He was put in charge of Team Luthor, which he renamed and remodeled after himself, calling them the 'Centurions'. When Superman was put on trial in front of an alien tribunal, the Centurion recruited Superboy, Supergirl, the Eradicator and Steel to rescue him. He had a brief falling out with the others, since they mistakenly believed for a time that he was the Cyborg Superman in disguise. After arriving back on Earth, he was publicly embarrassed by Lex Luthor[5] and quit Team Luthor before leaving Metropolis.[6] Alpha Centurion was last seen in Washington D.C."
