3518,Blood Brother(s) (Marvel),,3518_20071009111843_char.jpg,"Each Blood Brother's tremendous strength and durability is dependent on his proximity to his twin. When standing together, the two are capable of holding their own against Iron Man but if separated weaken to the point whereby the non-powered U.S.Agent is capable of knocking one of them out. |||| |||| The Brothers also drain the blood of victims in the manner of a vampire, although it is unclear as to whether they totally rely on blood for sustenance.",,"The Blood Brothers are large twin ape-like aliens originally in the service of the conqueror Thanos, acting as the guardians of his first base on Earth. Pursued by Drax the Destroyer, the duo battle the superheroes Iron Man and the Thing in a bid to stop them from interfering in Thanos' plans. When they fail to do so, a disgusted Thanos teleports the Blood Brothers away. |||| |||| They reappear years later on Earth in the service of the villain the Controller. Again they battle Iron Man, who defeats them with the aid of the hero Daredevil. Sometime later, the United States military discovers Thanos' old Earth base, and after activating some of the machinery accidentally teleports in the Blood Brothers. The two battle the Avengers and are eventually depowered by Thanos' brother, Eros. |||| |||| The Blood Brothers are imprisoned, but are later released by the hero Quasar and left on the planet Mars. Later, they attempt in vain to stop Rogue of the X-Men from rescuing a mutant extraterrestrial of the Skrull race.

Lived around the 1890's. |||| |||| Rose is the beautiful redheaded Irish girl who lived in the late 19th century and who came to live at the Howlett's mansion after the death of her parents. She was twelve years old when she first arrived and became James Howlett's constant companion. Originally, she became friends with James (Wolverine) Howlett and Dog Logan, a boy who was the son of the groundskeeper of the estate. However, as they aged, Rose and James grew apart from Dog Logan. Dog became more and more aggressive and started having sexual feelings towards Rose. After many unanswered and unwanted advances towards Rose, Dog eventually tried to rape her. The attempt failed but the two incidents caused James' father, John, to fire Dog's father, Thomas Logan. |||| |||| Angered by his being fired, Dog's father broke into the Howlett's property with his son and ordered Dog to keep the Howlett's under gunpoint. The scene escalates and John Howlett is killed by Dog's father. In turn, the young James kills Dog's father and severely wounds Dog. Rose, not knowing what to do, takes James away, leaving the estate. When the police arrive, Dog blames the whole thing on Rose and James. |||| |||| *** ON THE RUN *** |||| After being accused of the murders in the mansion, Rose and James traveled towards James' grandfather, Old Man Howlett. He however refused to help Rose and Logan, after which the pair goes on the run again, eventually traveling to the north of Canada. Eventually they end up in a small mining community deep within Canada where they start a new life. Rose claims James is her cousin named 'Logan' and soon begin to settle in the community. Rose always had a journal by hand in which she had described the events of her life. The two remain in the camp for several years, during which Rose grows up to become a beautiful young woman. James 'Logan' Howlett feels very attracted towards her, but these romantic feelings are not mutual. Eventually, Rose falls in love with Smitty, the camp's foreman. Smitty and Rose make plans to marry and move back to the city. Much to the grief of James. During this time, a ghost from the past reveals itself. Dog Logan, their former childhood friend, had tracked the pair down to the mining community, on strict orders from Old Man Howlett who wanted to make amends with his grandson. However, Dog Logan had different ideas and soon attacked James. During the fight, Rose tries to intervene and, tragically, is stabbed and killed accidentally when she falls onto Logan's extended claws."

42,Fire (DC),Beatriz Bonilla DaCosta ,42_20070301201450_char.jpg,"Originally Beatriz's only power, gained from a saturation by the organic energy source Pyroplasm, was the ability to breathe a jet of green flame from her mouth (this accident also permanently dyed her hair green as well). The fact that this wasn't terribly spectacular (the flame wasn't even a foot long) when compared to the abilities of other Justice Leaguers, especially when contrasted against Fire's bold and aggressive personality, was a minor running gag in early JLI stories. However the character proved popular and eventually earned an upgrade; during the Invasion cross-over event, the alien Dominators set off a 'metagene bomb' in the upper atmosphere which affected all super-powered DC characters and, after a period of illness, Fire found her powers greatly magnified as an after-effect. The 'new' Fire was now able to completely turn into a being of green flame, in which form she could fly and throw devastating blasts, similar to the Human Torch. Unfortunately, it took her some time to come to terms with her increased powers, and she often 'flamed on' involuntarily when stressed or angry (and sometimes still does), a distressingly common event for a character depicted as having a tendency towards passionate outbursts. |||| |||| Beatriz is also a skilled investigator and something of a natural seductress (or at least she's aware that her physical appearance grants her some degree of easy influence over others). Somewhat less frequently, she is shown to have a marketable fashion sense (having at times worked as a designer) and to have some resistance to mind control due to the fact that, as a native speaker of Portuguese, her mind is resistant to instructions given in English.",,"An operative for the Brazilian government who was caught in a massive explosion which triggered her metagene, turning her hair green and giving her the ability to breathe green fire from her mouth. Calling herself Green Flame she joined the international hero group the Global Guardians on behalf of her country. When this group dissolved, she and her friend Ice Maiden moved to the Justice League, where they soon distinguished themselves. During a massive alien invasion of Earth, Bea's powers were changed - after recovering from a flu-like affliction, she discovered she could transform her entire body into a green flame-like substance, flying along with it. She served with the League for many years, but now bases herself in Brazil, where she is a media celebrity as well as a hero. |||| |||| As depicted in The OMAC Project #4, it seems that after the dissolution of the Super Buddies Fire had returned to her work as detective and secret agent. In that role she helped Booster Gold and Guy Gardner to find the connection between Maxwell Lord and Blue Beetle's death. She then took part in an assault by her former teammates from Justice League International and the Super Buddies against a group of OMACs. Badly wounded, she was saved by the sacrifice of Rocket Red. |||| |||| Guy Gardner and Booster Gold took her to a hospital. After recovering, Fire appears in The OMAC Project Special, as an agent of Amanda Waller. |||| |||| One Year Later, she has become the Black King's Knight in the new ongoing Checkmate series. In the first issue of the series, Fire displays a notable change in her character as she is now depicted as an assassin and killer, a follow-up to the implication made by Amanda Waller in the OMAC Project Special that not only did she perform such duties during her secret agent days, but that she enjoyed killing. In issue 2 of Checkmate, however, it is indicated that Fire, while she will follow orders to kill, regrets taking part in a Checkmate mission in which as many as 50 Kobra personnel were killed, many immolated by Fire herself."

12,Beast (Marvel)(01 - Henry McCoy),Henry  P. McCoy ,12_20060123230419_char.jpg,"The Beast possesses superhuman strength, agility, endurance, and speed, despite his bulk. He possesses the agility of a great ape and the acrobatic prowess of an accomplished circus aerialist. His physiology is durable enough to allow him to survive a three story fall by landing on his feet without suffering any broken bones or sprains. The Beast's legs are powerful enough to enable him to leap approximately 15 feet high in a standing high jump, and around 25 feet in a standing broad jump. He can also run on all fours at approximately 40 miles per hour for short sprints. |||| The Beast can crawl up brick walls by wedging his fingers and toes into the smallest cracks and applying a vice-like grip on them, as well as walk a tightrope with minimal effort. He is adept in performing complicated sequences of gymnastics such as flips, rolls, and springs, and can also walk on his hands for many hours. Further, his manual and pedial dexterity are so great that he can perform multiple tasks such as writing with both hands at once or tie knots in rope with his toes. |||| |||| The Beast possesses enhanced senses, the ability to secrete pheromones to attract members of the opposite sex, as well as a slight healing factor that allows him to regenerate minor wounds and recover quickly from minor ailments such as colds. The Beast also possesses cat-like night vision as well as razor-sharp claws on his hands and feet.",,"While working at a nuclear power plant, Norton McCoy was exposed to massive amounts of radiation that affected his genes. As a result, Norton's son, Henry 'Hank' McCoy, was born a mutant who showed the signs of his being different from birth with his unusually large hands and feet. As a youth, Hank's freakish appearance was the subject of much ridicule from his classmates, earning him the nickname of 'beast'. However, one classmate named Jennifer came to know the real Hank after he began tutoring her in biology. On the night of the junior prom, Jennifer insisted that Hank accompany her as her date, and stood up for him after he was teased. |||| |||| In his senior year, Hank's superhuman agility and athletic prowess earned him recognition as a star football player. During one game, Hank easily stopped a trio of robbers who were attempting to escape across the football field. His efforts were noticed by the villain named the Conquistador who kidnapped Hank's parents in an effort to coerce the young mutant into working for him. The X-Men soon arrived and defeated the villain, and Hank was invited by Professor Charles Xavier to join the team of teenage mutant heroes and enroll in the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters. Unable to resist the temptation of a private institution that could offer him limitless academic opportunities, Hank accepted. |||| |||| A brilliant student, Hank completed his doctoral studies under Xavier's tutelage, and finally graduated from the Xavier School to take a position at the Brand Corporation as a genetic researcher under Doctor Carl Maddicks. During one of his experiments, Hank discovered the hormonal extract that causes genetic mutation and went to inform Maddicks of his findings. However, Maddicks was secretly plotting to steal top secret government documents, and Hank took it upon himself to stop Maddicks. In order to disguise his appearance, Hank took the extract and underwent radical physical changes that enhanced his agility and strength, as well as causing him to grow fangs, pointed ears, and fur all over his body. When he stayed too long in this state, Hank found he could not return to his original form. He was now a beast in fact as well as in name. At first, he tried to hide his mutation with a latex mask and gloves, but later learned to accept his new appearance. |||| |||| After receiving his doctorate in genetics and being considered one of the world's experts on mutations and evolutionary human biology, despite never having earned a Nobel Prize or been invited to join the National Academy of Sciences, Hank left Brand and applied to join the ranks of Earth's Mightiest Heroes, the Avengers. Initially accepted as a probationary member, Hank soon proved his worth and was granted full membership. During his time with the team he revealed his identity to the public in the hope that his status as an Avenger would help ease human/mutant tensions. |||| |||| Following a restructuring of the Avengers, Hank left and became involved with the team of adventurers known as the Defenders which he soon reorganized into a more formal and cohesive unit, bringing in his former X-Men teammates Iceman and Archangel. Following the apparent death of several of the Defenders, Hank reunited with the other four original X-Men to form X-Factor, an organization that intended to seek out and aid other mutants under the pretense of hunting them down. Shortly after the formation of X-Factor, Hank was captured by Maddicks who sought to experiment on Hank in an attempt to find a 'cure' for his son's own mutancy. However, the serum Hank was given caused him to revert to his original human appearance. Soon after, Hank first met television anchorwoman Trish Tilby, who was investigating X-Factor. |||| |||| During an attack on New York by the eternal mutant Apocalypse and his Four Horsemen, Hank was stricken with a virus that sapped his intellect and increased his strength every time he exerted himself physically. The more Hank used his strength, the stronger he got, but the less intelligent he became. Finally, to save his friend Iceman from the deadly kiss of the mutant named Infectia, Hank intervened and was himself affected, the result of which returned him to his blue-furred form and restored his intellect. Soon after, Hank and Trish began seeing each other romantically, however her work often intruded on their relationship and the pair ultimately called it off. |||| |||| After X-Factor disbanded, Hank returned to the ranks of the X-Men and became the team's resident technological and medical genius, working on everything from advanced alien technology to the deadly mutant-killing Legacy Virus. Hank also continued his on/off relationship with Trish until she released information on the Virus to the public, which caused hysteria that culminated in the beating to death of a young mutant. During this tenure with the X-Men, Hank was lured into a trap and replaced in the ranks of the X-Men by the Dark Beast, an alternate-reality version of himself. Sealed behind a brick wall, Hank was nearly about to give up and let fate win when his water tube broke and spurted, revealing the grooves of a trap door in his cell. Energized by hope, Hank broke his restraints and escaped with the aid of the new government-sponsored X-Factor team. Hank returned to the X-Men, and soon after met with Trish to apologize for his previous harsh treatment of her. She forgave him and the pair renewed their relationship. |||| |||| Hank eventually took an extended leave of absence from the X-Men to work on a cure for the Legacy Virus, which he ultimately found thanks to his implementing the work of his former colleague, the late Moira MacTaggert. Soon after, Hank joined Storm's team of X-Treme X-Men in their quest for the diaries of the late mutant seer Destiny. Almost killed in the team's first battle with the villainous Vargas, Hank's life was saved by his teammate Tessa who used a heretofore-unseen power to accelerate the Beast's mutation to a new level. Hank returned to Xavier's mansion to recuperate and mutated further, becoming bulkier, heavier, and taking on a more leonine appearance. Forced to relearn fine motor control over his body, Hank once again served as the team's resident genius, as well as an active teacher of dozens of young mutants at the renamed Xavier Institute of Higher Learning. |||| |||| Unable to deal with his latest mutation, Trish called Hank and ended their relationship over the phone. Soon after, Hank was beaten into a coma by a student possessed by Professor Xavier's malevolent twin Cassandra Nova, who herself had possessed Xavier's body. Hank recovered in time to expose her plans and Cassandra was ultimately defeated, but not before she had exposed her brother Charles to the world as a mutant, forever changing life at the Xavier mansion for the X-Men."

Upon the death of Emperor Rilsom XVIII, Gavyn's sister Clryssa betrayed him to get to the throne herself, and left him in space to die. A being named M'ntorr saved Gavyn and taught him to use the cosmic powers he had been gifted with. Eventually, Gavyn overthrew his sister's rogue government, and ascended the throne together with his Lady Merria. Gavyn eventually sacrificed his life in the great Crisis. However, there have been theories that his life essence traveled through space and 'possessed' the dead body of an Earthman named Will Payton, who became Starman V. Recently Payton (as Gavyn), Starman III and VII, and other heroes overthrew the new Throneworld government, led by rogue security officer Jediah Rikane. Although Will Payton is still not completely sure that he really is Prince Gavyn, he has agreed to stay on Throneworld with Lady Merria and rule the empire for the time being."

She battled the original Justice League of America several times early in the group's history, but she was at her most dangerous when she recently worked with Lex Luthor and his Injustice Gang to attempt the ruin of the current JLA. On this occasion, she set up a hive in New York, producing many more drones, but was overcome by her simple inability to detect the color red."
382,Edwin Jarvis (Marvel),,382_20070103013632_char.jpg,,,"Edwin Jarvis was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, but during World War II, he ran away to join the Canadian Royal Air Force to fight for Britain against the Nazis as an underage pilot. Perhaps it was during this time he acquired his accent and learned how to be a 'gentlemen's gentlemen.' Returning to the United States, he found a position as butler for Howard Stark and Maria Stark. He watched their mansion even after their death. |||| |||| The Starks' son, Tony, called the first meeting of the Avengers as Iron Man and donated the house as headquarters, so that it became Avengers Mansion. Jarvis grew accustomed to the guests and served the Avengers for many years on, acting as a father figure to some newcomers. He is the only person who has been with the Avengers for their entire existence, a distinction not even Captain America can claim. |||| |||| Aside from serving and supporting the Avengers, Jarvis has also had his share of various adventures. Once, early in his association with the team, Jarvis became desperate for money due to his mother's extreme illness. He accepted the money from the original Crimson Cowl (soon revealed to be the robot Ultron) in exchange for providing blueprints to the Avengers' mansion. Ultron captured the Avengers and hypnotized Jarvis to believe he was the Crimson Cowl. The Avengers soon turned the tables on Ultron and helped Jarvis regain his identity and restore his mother to health. |||| |||| At other times, Jarvis helped rescue the hapless captive Judy Parks from Graviton and helped the Avengers subdue a time-displaced D'Artagnan. Once, Jarvis stood up to and fought the Bruiser, a neighborhood bully who robbed his mother. He further inspired her neighbors to join him in driving Bruiser out of the neighborhood. |||| |||| During the fourth Masters of Evil attack on the mansion, Jarvis was savagely beaten and almost lost an eye to the marauders, brutally tortured by Mister Hyde. Jarvis was rescued by the Avengers and took a leave of absence to recuperate. Jarvis later returned once he had sufficiently healed from his injuries. Soon after, the Avengers temporarily disbanded from active duty, and Jarvis was temporarily relieved, until the Avengers reassembled. During the Avengers temporary disbanding, Jarvis met and began dating Glory Garsen. |||| |||| Upon reassembling, the Avengers expanded their 'ground crew' to include other non-superhuman job dutites, of which Jarvis enjoyed a senior position as 'Chief of Staff.' At one point, the Ground Crew was brainwashed by the Skeleton Crew into attacking the Avengers, although they were easily defeated and freed from the Skeleton Crew's control. When Crystal took up residence in the mansion with her daughter Luna, she brought with her a nanny, Marilla. The two became rivals over various domestic duties but over time became fond of each other. Eventually, the Avengers' Ground Crew was dismissed and Jarvis remained the sole domestic worker for the mansion once more. |||| |||| Later still, Jarvis was relieved of duty when the Avengers disbanded again, this time presumably permanently due to the perceived death of many members by the entity known as Onslaught. Jarvis felt extremely displaced and sank into a depression, living off his pension from the Stark Foundation. Even so, he helped his former co-Ground Crew member Fabian Stankowicz deactivate his Protectorate robots, robots meant to replace the Avengers but had gone renegade. When the Avengers returned and reassembled, Jarvis also returned to service, with a renewed sense of duty. |||| |||| Jarvis recently revealed that he had been sponsoring a foreign child, Maria de Guadalupe 'Lupe' Santiago, and had the opportunity to meet her in person as she came to New York for college. The Avengers soon discovered Lupe was the superhuman adventurer Silverclaw and was placed in Jarvis' sponsorship precisely because of his connection to the Avengers. Silverclaw aided the Avengers against the arms dealer Moses Magnum, and was later offered provisional membership in the group. |||| |||| When Spider-Man joined Tony Stark's reassembled Avengers, he moved his family into Stark Tower. Subsequently, Jarvis began developing a romantic relationship with Peter's Aunt May."

1228,Hawkeye (Marvel)(01 - Clint Barton),Clint Barton ,1228_20061025043816_char.jpg,,,"Clint Barton was orphaned at an early age when his parents died in a car accident and was sent to a children's home with his brother Bernard. He and his brother ran away to join the Carson Carnival of Traveling Wonders, and the pair worked as roustabouts. While a member of the circus, Hawkeye was trained by the original Swordsman (Jacques Duquesne) and Trickshot. Clint's life, however, would forever be changed after he stumbled onto the Swordsman counting the money he had just robbed from the carnival. The Swordsman offered Clint to become his partner in crime, but Clint rejected his mentor, sparking a fight that ended when the Swordsman left him for dead after he fell from the high wire. Barney, too, abandoned him, in disbelief that Clint passed up such an opportunity. Trickshot stepped up his role as Clint's mentor, later asking him to join him in raiding a criminal named Marko. However, Clint severely injured one of Marko's guards and discovered him to be his brother, Barney. Repelled by the consequences of his actions (and his mentor's role in prompting them), he abandoned Trickshot and parted on bad terms. |||| |||| His natural archery abilities honed to an expert level, Clint wandered the country, working in various carnivals or otherwise making money out of the costume and persona of 'Hawkeye'. One day, when witnessing Iron Man save the lives of some people at the carnival, he decided to become a costumed crime-fighter himself. But as luck would have it, on Hawkeye's first night on patrol, he was mistaken for a criminal by the police and hunted down. |||| |||| He soon met the Black Widow, who was working at the time as a costumed villain for her country, and she easily seduced the hot-headed adventurer, making him think it was in his interest to defeat Iron Man. He attempted to do so according to her prompting on several occasions, but soon wised up, regretting his decision. Instead, he hoped to join Iron Man's team of Avengers. As a way of proving himself, he broke into the Avengers Mansion and convinced their butler, Jarvis, to play the role of a victim so he could display his powers. Iron Man vouched for Hawkeye, and he joined the new line-up that included Captain America, the Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver. |||| |||| Clint continued to be an active member of the Avengers for years, with his archery skills matching the superhuman powers of his teammates. His brash attitude initially chafed under the leadership of Captain America, and, although it took some time to come to respect him, the two have become good friends. Also at first, he felt attracted the Scarlet Witch, even to the point of having trouble getting over her eventual marriage to the Vision. For years, he also continued to hold a torch for the Black Widow, until she returned to her espionage career and told him that she had never loved him (although she said that in order to keep him away.) |||| |||| Hawkeye stayed with the Avengers for a long time, leaving only briefly when his temper and ego led him to believe he wasn't wanted. He returned after a short period, having joined the 'non-team' Defenders in the meantime. At one point, Hawkeye was passed over accompanying the Avengers in the Kree-Skrull War due to his lack of superhuman abilities. Not one to be deterred so easily, Hawkeye took on the identity of Goliath with the use of Hank Pym's size-altering particles. He hitched a ride so as to join the team in their intergalactic adventure and maintained the Goliath identity for several months upon their return to Earth. |||| |||| During his time as Goliath, Clint was approached by his brother, who had become a big-time racketeer. Barney had learned of Egghead's plans to construct an orbiting laser death-ray to extort money from the United States and came to the Avengers for help. The Avengers confronted Egghead and his allies, the Mad Thinker and the Puppet Master, but tragically, Barney died in the ensuing battle. Later, Egghead would use the Swordsman to capture Clint as Goliath, thinking him to be Hank Pym, but Hawkeye-as-Goliath soon defeated both criminals, avenging his brother at last. Soon afterward, Clint abandoned the Goliath identity but continued to serve the Avengers as Hawkeye the Marksman. |||| |||| Another leave of absence was forced upon him, when, due to a type of 'affirmative action', he was replaced by the Falcon to comply with the Avengers' government sanction. During this time, he eventually found employment as a night security guard for Cross Technological Enterprises (CTE). Never gone from his team for long, he soon rejoined the fold, although one particular solo adventure would have a lasting impact. His boss, head of CTE, was the villain known as Crossfire and hoped to test his ultrasonic equipment with which he hoped to turn heroes against one another, With the help of the ex-secret agent, Mockingbird, Hawkeye defeated Crossfire. The two heroes, head over heels in love, promptly got married. |||| |||| At the time, the Vision was expanding the Avengers' operations, and he named Hawkeye chairman of a west coast branch of Avengers, and Mockingbird joined him as a charter member. Hawkeye led the team through several adventures, growing into a competent leader, and he even had time to embark on a series of solo adventures. During one of these latter adventures, Hawkeye had to defend himself against many costumed mercenaries and villains hoping to collect a bounty placed on his right arm. The mastermind behind it all proved to be Trickshot, now dying of cancer, and he was hoping to goad Hawkeye into killing him. Instead, Hawkeye reconciled with his former mentor and friend. |||| |||| During an adventure where the team became lost in the past, his wife was involved with the death of the Old West hero, the Phantom Rider, and the situation caused the couple to split up. Shortly after, the government forced the membership of the U.S.Agent on the team, and Hawkeye quit. Both he and Mockingbird wound up investigating and leading the heroes known as the Great Lakes Avengers. Eventually, however, Hawkeye left the Midwest to rejoin the Avengers West Coast, although he never really led the team again. |||| Hawkeye continued to adventure with the team, even alongside his separated wife, and was present with them when Mockingbird was killed in a demonic dimension, saving her husband's life from an attack by Mephisto. Distraught, Hawkeye left the team and took a cross-country walkabout. Later, Clint was commissioned to train a group of rebels known as the Shadows along with Sundance and Striker. He attempted to keep them from killing, but on one raid Striker killed a woman and injured her fiancé, a friend of James Rhodes. As War Machine, Rhodes was surprised to see Hawkeye among the rebels, and even more so when a government backed group led by the U.S.Agent also arrived. The three were able to stop the conflict and were confronted by the mysterious Advisor. |||| |||| Eventually drawn back to the Avengers' fold when the team was attacked in a plan orchestrated by Immortus, Hawkeye was present with the team when they apparently died, sacrificing themselves to absorb the energies of Onslaught. Eventually, Hawkeye and the other heroes were restored, and Hawkeye quickly rejoined the reforming Avengers. |||| |||| However, Hawkeye was dissatisfied. His previous experience as a team leader left him feeling too anxious as a regular member. Hawkeye turned his attention instead to the team of reforming villains, the Thunderbolts. Sympathetic because of his own outlaw past and eager for new challenges, Hawkeye offered to serve as the Thunderbolts' new leader if they would continue fighting crime and remain reformed. During his stint as their leader, he became a friend and mentor to the group, honing their skills and greatly enhancing their reputations. He and his teammate Moonstone had even began developing romantic inclinations. The Thunderbolts soon became trusted allies of the Avengers, though Hawkeye formally resigned his membership in the latter group since he didn't want any perceived criminal association with the Thunderbolts to negatively impact the Avengers. |||| |||| Unfortunately, CSA agent and former Avengers government liaison Henry Peter Gyrich targeted the Thunderbolts for assassination as part of a larger scheme to eradicate superhumans. Hawkeye and the Thunderbolts exposed and thwarted Gyrich's conspiracy, freeing Gyrich himself from the mind-controlling technology Baron Strucker had used to make Gyrich act out his anti-superhuman fantasies. Hawkeye agreed to keep the entire affair a secret in exchange for a full federal pardon for the other Thunderbolts, but a bitterly furious Gyrich refused to go along with concealing the incident unless Hawkeye went to prison for operating as an illegal vigilante with the Thunderbolts. Hawkeye agreed and was remanded to federal custody. |||| |||| While in Seagate Federal Penitentiary, Barton was contacted telepathically by Mentallo, who orchestrated a break-out for Hawkeye and three others (one of which was a Mentallo-possessed Headlok). Despite their success, the inmates remained remotely 'chained' to each other. The so-called “Chain Gang” reluctantly agreed to work together to search for a way to survive, deactivate their security manacles, and to search for a weapon of great power left behind by the death of the criminal industrialist Justin Hammer. Unknown to his associates, Barton was actually working undercover on behalf of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., who hoped to use Barton as a mole to track Mentallo's criminal activities. S.H.I.E.L.D. also hired the Thunderbolts' Songbird, who tracked Hawkeye and defeated his erstwhile allies. They discovered that Hammer's legacy was a biological toxin that had been ingested by every single villain who had ever worked for him and that one of the villains, Plantman, was the carrier. Hawkeye, Songbird, and Plantman began a new search for the trigger that would release Plantman's toxin. The search ended with Hammer's daughter, Justine, who turned out to be the Crimson Cowl, leader of the Masters of Evil. Hawkeye convinced several members of the Masters of Evil to side with him and Songbird against Crimson Cowl and their former allies, pointing out the dangers of the super-weapon. Hoping to throw off suspicion, Hawkeye made the villains reinvent their costumed identities, thus creating a new team of Thunderbolts. The group ultimately defeated the Crimson Cowl and her Masters of Evil, and Plantman (as Blackheath) managed to release an antidote for the toxin into the atmosphere. |||| |||| Hawkeye and his Thunderbolts also helped Citizen V and the V-Battalion to help destroy their headquarters' engine of alien technology that had began distorting, In so doing, they were reunited with other the Thunderbolts, led by Baron Zemo and trapped on Counter-Earth. The two teams combined forces to shunt the alien ship from Earth. After much discussion, most of the costumed heroes and villains chose to part company. Hawkeye agreed to leave the Thunderbolts to Zemo's leadership, reluctantly agreeing that Zemo had proved he had potential to be a hero. |||| |||| Hawkeye returned to the Avengers full-time. At one point, he and the Wasp had a dallying romance, upsetting Yellowjacket, and the two heroes avoided talking about the uncomfortable situation. Soon afterwards, however, the Avengers suffered a series of sudden and devastating attacks from friends and enemies alike, culminating in a surprise attack by the alien Kree. During the Kree invasion, Hawkeye suffered a mortal shot to the back. In his dying moments, Hawkeye overpowered a Kree soldier, using the soldier's jetpack to fly both of them into the Kree's command ship. Hawkeye sacrificed his life to single-handedly thwart the invasion. (These attacks were in part motivated by the Scarlet Witch, whose mind became unhinged with the magical powers she constantly felt forced to control, and it is believed the Kree invasion was all a magical construct of the Scarlet Witch.) |||| |||| Hawkeye showed up alive once more in the Scarlet Witch's mutant-dominated alternate reality, with no memory of the reality before. When a young mutant gave several of the heroes the ability to remember the way the world once was, Clint and the others were horrified at what the Scarlet Witch had done. With his memory restored, Hawkeye remembered the events his own death. When the heroes confronted the Witch and her children, Hawkeye angrily shot her in the back, demanding to know why she had killed him, as he was her friend and had only love for her. One of the Witch's children made Hawkeye vanish into nothingness with just a thought. After reality was restored several heroes arrived at the ruined Avengers Mansion after a report that someone had been there, only to find Clint's costume and a newspaper cutting about his death, pinned to the ruins by Hawkeye's trademark purple arrows. |||| |||| It was later revealed that Clint indeed survived and that he was the one who nailed the costume on the wall. He realized that the whole world thought that he was dead and he himself also had doubts of who he really was. In his disordered state of mind he found himself standing in front of Doctor Strange's house. He met Strange who ensured him that he was who he thinks he is and that he is indeed alive. Strange informed him of what had happened and that Wanda couldn't be found and that he thought she might be dead. Clint didn't believe this and started to search for her. He found her in Wundagore Mountain where she lived with her aunt Agatha. She didn't remember anything and didn't recognize him at all. She also told him that she had lived her whole life in that village. Clint decided to stay in the village for some time with her until he for some reason came back to the states and contacted Iron Man revealing to him that he was alive. After Iron Man had ensured that he was who he said he was he made Clint an offer to be the next Captain America. Clint even tried the flag on and got to use the original shield but he realized that it was a mistake when he met Patriot and new Hawkeye who convinced that he wasn't Captain America. Clint let them escape and gave the shield back to Iron Man and told him that he will mail the 'flag' later. Not long after this Clint again found himself in front of Doctor Strange's house now seeming as though it had been abandoned and sold to a franchise company. In reality, however, it was illusion cast by Strange to hide himself and his team members from Iron Man. They decided to show themselves to Clint and after some talk and magic they decided to give Clint Ronin's costume. They then left to Japan to save their team member Maya Lopez from the Hand."
18286,Vision (Marvel)(03 - Jonas),Jonas ,18286_20080111160848_char.jpg,"In his current configuration, the Vision has control over his density, ranging from total intangibility to infrangible hardness (and has demonstrated sufficient fine control of this power to render an opponent unconscious by making his hand partially tangible within the opponent's chest cavity). He can also emit beams from a gemlike emitter on his forehead, and is able to readily interface with computer technology, to the point that he can learn to fly a Kree warship merely by linking to it. He can be worn as a suit of armour by a teammate or ally. |||| |||| In his original configuration as Kang the Conqueror's armour, the Vision is capable of forming impenetrable force fields, plucking weapons from nearly anywhere in the time stream, and traveling through time unaided. He has not demonstrated these abilities in his present configuration.","The Vision experiences debilitating feedback when physically close to Victor Mancha, due to the similarity of their operating systems' code (both are based on the Ultron OS developed by Dr Hank Pym). The same feedback can be caused over long distance by viewing damage to Mancha over a nonsecure medium.","The Vision began life as the nonsentient armour of time-traveling warlord Kang the Conqueror. When a time-displaced teen-aged variant of Kang came to the 21st century seeking to avoid his future, he wore the armour briefly as Iron Lad, founder and original leader of the Young Avengers. While in his past, Iron Lad downloaded the operating system and memory files of the defunct Vision into his armour. During the battle with Kang, the Vision OS became active and the armour manifested as Vision. This new Vision has elected to remain a member of the Young Avengers."

To better allow this robot sentience, Ultron brainwashed his own maker, Henry Pym, into transferring the mind of his wife, Janet Van Dyne, the Wasp, into a feminine robotic shell he named Jocasta, after the wife/mother in the legend of Oedipus (A reference to the fact that Ultron's obsession with Pym- his 'father'- reflects a real-life manifestation of the Oedipus Complex). The Wasp, in Jocasta's body, alerted her teammates, the Avengers, who defeated Ultron and reversed the process, leaving Jocasta a mindless husk. |||| |||| Ultron later revived Jocasta with a remote link, activating the mental 'residue' the Wasp left behind. Jocasta was programmed to be loyal to Ultron but eventually betrayed him, choosing to help the Avengers defeat him again. Afterwards, Jocasta adventured with the Avengers for a brief time, proving particularly helpful in their first confrontation with the villainous Taskmaster, who possessed photographic reflexes that let him duplicate any move he'd seen only once; having never even seen Jocasta before, the Taskmaster couldn't predict what she might be about to do. Due to their similar backgrounds, she developed feelings for Vision, but he was happily married to the Scarlet Witch and could not return Jocasta's feelings. Jocasta did not believe she was accepted by most of the team, and left them in Avengers #211, just before she, unbeknownst to her, was to be made an official member. |||| |||| Wandering the country, Jocasta was controlled by a pre-programmed suggestion to rebuild Ultron. She did, but soon teamed up with the Fantastic Four member, The Thing, and the robot called Machine Man to defeat Ultron. Sacrificing herself to try to kill Ultron, Ultron nevertheless survived until Machine Man reached down his throat to tear out vital circuitry. The Avengers held a memorial for their fallen ally, and the Machine Man attended, realizing his love for Jocasta. |||| |||| Jocasta was reassembled some time later by agents of the megalomaniac villain, the High Evolutionary. Jocasta retains enough of her programming to signal the Avengers. The team had disbanded at the time but the signal got through to reserve members. The Beast, The Captain, Falcon, Hercules, The Hulk and Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara) all end up assembling in order to combat this new threat. Jocasta helps them in fighting the Evolutionary's force and locating his base deep below the surface of the ocean. Jocasta sacrifices herself once again to blow up the Evolutionary's base, but not before Captain America assured her that she was a true Avenger. |||| |||| Jocasta's robotic head was later discovered by Machine Man, who had been working on a way to resurrect his lover, when he was attacked by a form of the alien Terminus. In the same area, the arms dealer known as Madame Menace became involved in the fray, and found Jocasta's lost head, appropriating it for her own purposes. Much later, Madame Menace manipulated events so that Tony Stark would unlock Jocasta's programming so that she would become the basis for Menace's new weapons systems. Tony Stark soon realized the identity of the android helped Jocasta to awaken, and Jocasta managed to turn the tables on Madame Menace, seemingly sacrificing herself yet again. |||| |||| In reality, Jocasta managed to survive by downloading her intelligence into Iron Man's computerized armor, where she reasserted herself. Jocasta's intelligence was placed within Tony Stark's computerized mansion, and she would help him with daily operation of his mansion as well as to procure information as needed. Having been programmed with the latest in diagnostic, preventative medical and surgical techniques, Jocasta also spent time serving as Stark's physician/psychologist, providing him with someone he could talk to about his problems and who could examine his latest injuries without risking his secret identity being compromised. |||| |||| Unfortunately, since the Iron Man armor was used to house the programming that made up Jocasta, it became infected with the pre-programmed subconscious suggestion to rebuild Ultron, but, instead, managed to develop its own artificial intelligence. Stark was almost killed in a confrontation with the armor, but, in the end, it sacrificed itself to allow Stark to live. Stark left the armor buried on a deserted island. The armor was revived, however, by the Sons of Yinsen, a quasi-religious cult founded in remembrance of Yinsen, the co-creator of the original Iron Man armor that allowed Tony Stark to escape his Communist captors in Vietnam. Free of its artificial intelligence, the armor was contacted via remote by the head of Ultron, disembodied after his most recent encounter of the Avengers and in the company of the bio-synthetic robot being known as Antigone. The head attached itself onto the armor and took control of the Sons of Yinsen and the flying city that they inhabited. |||| |||| Another member of the Sons of Yinsen was helping Tony Stark in the guise of Iron Man. The two learned of Ultron's activities and that he planned to use the cult to wipe out humanity. Stark confronted Ultron directly and finally managed to download Jocasta's intelligence into the armor once more. The vestiges of the armor's intelligence battled with the presence Jocasta, the result of which caused Ultron's head to come shooting off the armor. The head hit Antigone, and both fell off the floating city, which Ultron rigged to explode after his defeat. Stark failed to find a trace of Jocasta and assumed her to have died fighting the sentient armor. |||| |||| In reality, Jocasta did not die. She appeared in possession of Antigone's body and left, taking Ultron's head with her. |||| |||| Recently Jocasta was seen at the Avengers mansion in her classic silver robotic form. However, since Quicksilver stated that his own presence at the mansion during that crisis was apparently an illusion created by the Scarlet Witch, it is uncertain whether this was the real Jocasta or another illusion."

Ares was worshiped as the god of war in both ancient Greece and ancient Rome. After the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire , Zeus allowed the worship of the Olympians to die out, and Ares was no longer allowed to act as patron god of warriors. As a result over the ensuing centuries Ares grew increasingly dissatisfied with Zeus’ rule. He has tried to conquer Olympus on several occasions sometimes in league with his uncle Pluto, god of the Olympian underworld. His half-brother Hercules has opposed his attempts at conquest almost every time sometimes with the help of his allies including Thor the Asgardian god of thunder, and the Avengers. Ares has hated Hercules since Hercules killed Ares’ monstrous Stymphalian birds during Hercules’ original twelve labors. |||| |||| |||| Ares has fought the Avengers on numerous occasions, as well as his half-brother Hercules. Ares has also fought the Champions, the Eternal Ikaris and a variety of other denizens of Earth. Recently warriors from the East have attacked Olympus and the Olympians have sought the assistance of Ares. Ares who had retired from warfare and the life of the gods has only recently joined the battle due to the kidnapping of his son. |||| Wanting his son to live the life of a mortal instead of under the rule of his father, Ares decided to raise his son on Earth instead of Olympus.

Ares agreed as long as they would match his hourly pay."

6543,Iron Maniac (Marvel)(Earth-5012),Anthony Stark ,6543_20081209043725_char.jpg,,,"Iron Maniac is an evil alternate universe version of Iron Man from Earth 5012. He first appeared in Marvel Team-Up (Vol. 3) #2, wearing armor that bears heavy resemblance to that of Doctor Doom (and is, because of that, mistaken for that villain). |||| |||| He comes from an alternate reality where most of the Avengers were killed when they encountered the vicious alien Titannus in space. While the team is rescued by the reserve Avengers five years later, it takes another five years to fight back the Trellions- the alien race that has brainwashed Titannus- and, during that time, an apparently power-hungry Reed Richards turns his back on the surviving heroes. (The exact circumstances behind this are unknown.) Scarred for life due to an attack from the Human Torch shortly before the aforementioned hero is killed, Iron Man sets his own operation base in Latveria for the express purpose of 'take over the world to save it from Richards,' until Richards somehow manages to banish him into Earth-616 (other differences between his world and the one we know include that there is no Spider-Man - or, at least, he and Iron Man have never met - and that Hank Pym is another version of the Hulk). |||| |||| After being transported to Earth 616, the alternate Iron Man fights the Fantastic Four and Doctor Strange, all of whom initially assumed him to be their Doctor Doom having escaped from Hell. However, after he unmasks himself, they learn his true identity, shortly before he manages to temporarily negate the FF's powers and escape. Capturing a recently-discovered mutant, the alternate Iron Man attempts to return to his home dimension, but is attacked by Spider-Man and X-23. After the appearance of Captain America and Black Widow, he realizes that he is in an alternate world, but continues to fight the heroes, calling them all 'Richards' lackeys'. He is defeated thanks to Spider-Man and X-23's use of their own version of the fastball special to destroy his equipment, shortly after 'warning' the other heroes of the Titannus War (by saying that he wouldn't kill them now because it would be a kindness). |||| |||| While the alternate Tony Stark is kept locked up and drugged in the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, he is briefly visited by his counterpart in this universe, although he is unaware of the visit. Shortly after the alternate Stark is transferred to a conventional cell, Titannus soon arrives and fights the heroes, this time confronting a new group of Defenders assembled by Doctor Strange. When Titannus' comatose lover is revived, she tells him that she never loved him and that he was insane, causing Titannus to kill himself. The alternate Iron Man later discovers from Spider-Man and Wolverine that the Avengers were never massacred in space in this reality because the group had been disassembled, thus never encountering Titannus and averting the so-called 'Titannus War'. |||| |||| He has recently broken free from captivity, having immunized himself to the gas that was used to keep him sedated onboard the SHIELD Helicarrier. In the process he gains the unwilling alliance of the LMD Diamondback. Having convinced her that he is the 'real' Tony, the AU Tony Stark erases her memories, and reshapes the former LMD into an advanced suit of armor. This armor, even more advanced than the pre-Extremis suit Iron Man wore at that time, is able to replicate any weapon from the wearer's memory. He subsequently battles Spider-Man, Wolverine, Captain America and Luke Cage, but is only defeated after the sacrifice of rookie hero Freedom Ring, who kept Iron Maniac occupied long enough for Captain America to knock him out with a shield thrown at the back of his neck. |||| |||| The name Iron Maniac is what he decided to call himself, due to being the 'sole survivor of a sane world living in a backwards, insane world,'. |||| |||| Iron Maniac is known to be at least partially cyborgized, with armor plating implanted in his chest (revealed during his escape from the Helicarrier, when he is shot with a bullet). It is unknown whether the rest of his body is similarly armored or if he possesses other cybernetic enhancements. |||| |||| He has been briefly mentioned as being held in a Shield Hellicarrier recently in The Irredeemable Ant-Man."

Grieving and enraged, he came upon a church built on a site of old pagan power, rich in absorbed mystical energy. Derwyddon brought the gargoyles on it to life, sending them out to wreak vengeance, but witnessing the carnage they wrought, he came to his senses, withdrawing the spell, returning most of them to stone. A few escaped. One of them was eventually ensorcelled as a mage’s familiar, from whom it learned much of the black arts; after seventy years of servitude, it slew its master. It spent the next few centuries stalking the innocent, eventually assembling human worshippers, and in modern times, came to the attention of the demonic Six-Fingered Hand. The gargoyle sought to join their number as an equal, but was treated as a slave, and when it rebelled, they punished it. |||| |||| Isaac Christians was born in Christiansboro, Virginia, a town founded by his ancestors. His life was full of regrets. As a child he accidentally pushed his brother Jeremiah off the roof to his death during a game. Stricken with guilt, Isaac built an emotional shell around himself, gradually emerging years later thanks to his friends, Elaine Willoughby and Buster Henderson; they called themselves the “Three Musketeers”, and while Buster was Isaac’s idol, Elaine was his first crush. When Buster became engaged to Elaine, Isaac was devastated. Soon after America entered the First World War; Buster swiftly signed up. Isaac followed soon after, but panicked when a sniper’s bullet killed a comrade on his first day in the trenches. Fleeing, Isaac ran into Buster, but soon saw him cut down by a hail of German gunfire while Isaac froze in terror. After the war Isaac abandoned his hometown and its memories. He traveled to Paris, where he became obsessed with Germaine, a prostitute bearing an uncanny resemblance to Elaine. Eventually, when she left him, Isaac resumed his travels, finally reaching Hyderabad, India, where for two years he became a follower of the holy man Vishnu Dass, gradually regaining his faith. His journey ended with a letter informing him his father had died; Isaac returned home to take on his familial responsibilities, spending decades as Christiansboro’s mayor until he retired. |||| |||| Increasingly upset at Christiansboro’s decline into poverty, Isaac read old books on magic, then summoned up Avarrish, one of the Six-Fingered Hand, who promised to save Christiansboro if Isaac would temporarily serve him. Agreeing, Isaac found himself in the body of the gargoyle, and was sent to kidnap Patsy Walker (Hellcat), nearly killing her housekeeper Dolly Donahue in the execution of this task. Isaac carried out a ceremony to make Patsy a demonic host; when her Defenders teammates arrived, he led a horde of demons against them, but because he tried to warn them off rather than slay them, Avarrish trapped him in the gargoyle body. After Hellcat was exorcised, the Defenders confronted the penitent Isaac; wishing to atone, he joined their ranks as Gargoyle, fighting other pawns of the Hand, including Dracula, Gordski and his undead legions, Asmodeus Jones, David Kessler and the Man-Thing, before finally confronting the true powers behind the group, an alliance of Hell Lords. Patsy, previously resentful towards him, finally forgave him in light of her own experiences during this battle, forging an enduring friendship; Isaac also became increasingly close to the recovered Dolly, finding their similar ages gave them much in common. |||| |||| Isaac remained with the Defenders, battling the Serpent-Men and attending the funeral of Captain Marvel, but became increasingly depressed by his perceived failure to save Christiansboro. Alongside the Defenders, he returned home to find the town full of ghostly apparitions. While Isaac was haunted by visions of his family, other specters overwhelmed the Defenders; fleeing the taunting ghosts, Isaac found his friends under attack from Null the Living Darkness, and used his own lifeforce to drive it off. The exhausted Gargoyle, near death, was saved by his family’s ghosts; having not been conjured by Null, they replenished him and informed him of their love, restoring his will to live. |||| |||| The next few months saw Isaac battle alongside the Defenders against the Secret Empire and the Enchantress, fight the Avengers as a pawn in the alien Supernalia’s feud against her estranged husband Nebulon, and travel to Earth-712 to free the Squadron Supreme from Null the Living Darkness’ new pawn, the Overmind. En route home, Isaac, Valkyrie, Beast and Namor took an extradimensional detour to the bizarre reality Here; dubbed “They” by the locals, the group obtained the Ruby Sneakers from the evil Lord Mayor Easy-Read the First to get home. While his relationship with Dolly slowly blossomed into love, Isaac took part in the Grandmaster’s Contest of Champions, joined other heroes in congratulating the Hulk on his pardon, and battled the Miracle Man after he stole the Son of Satan’s darksoul. Soon after Isaac attended the wedding of Daimon and Patsy, fighting agents of the Secret Empire who interrupted the nuptials. Following the Beast’s renovation of the team, the Defenders continued their vendetta with the Secret Empire and relocated to New Mexico. Magically kidnapped by an Afghan wizard for use as a familiar, Isaac was trapped within a pentagram-inscribed orb, until he tricked the wizard into coming to America, where the Defenders managed to free him. |||| |||| Drawn home by Elaine’s death, Isaac met the gargoyle’s spirit now wearing his old body. He allowed it to swap their forms, but the Gargoyle and its surviving fellows went on a rampage. Derwyddon, who had been tracking down the gargoyles, helped Isaac overcome his feelings of failure; after Derwyddon turned the other gargoyles to stone, Isaac reclaimed his demonic form, then slew his old body which again hosted the gargoyle’s spirit. During a subsequent visit to Dr. Strange’s house, Isaac was drawn to steal a crystal without knowing why; sometime later a possessed Moondragon ripped out Isaac’s soul and turned his gargoyle body into her pawn, warping it into an even more monstrous visage. Several of the Defenders, aided by the Interloper, sacrificed themselves, using their lifeforces to turn it, Moondragon and themselves to dust. |||| |||| Isaac’s unbound spirit entered the crystal he had taken from Strange’s sanctum, which was found by a soldier involved in the clean-up after the battle. Isaac controlled the soldier, tracking down Moondragon’s still active spirit, catching up with her when she made contact with her cousin Pamela Douglas. Moondragon convinced Isaac to accompany her and Pamela to Titan, where the Eternals grew Moondragon a new body. For his part, Isaac hung round Pamela’s neck, until she became Sundragon, using her new powers to give him a new body, capable of changing between human and gargoyle forms. While Moondragon returned to Earth, Isaac left for deep space with Sundragon, Cloud and the Titanian Eternal Demeityr, but was captured by the Stranger. Eventually Isaac escaped the Stranger’s Lab World with many of the other inmates and returned to Earth. |||| |||| Isaac sought out Dolly, resuming their relationship, but after she died of old age he moved in with Patsy and Daimon Hellstrom at their mansion at Fire Lake, Massachusetts. Having lost his darksoul Daimon began to die; Patsy worked with Isaac to summon “Satan” to help his son, but the sight of Daimon’s true, demonic face drove Patsy insane. Isaac stayed on to care for Patsy, and tried to keep Daimon from straying too far. Even after Patsy’s suicide, and disapproving of Daimon’s new consort, Jaine Cutter, Isaac felt he had nowhere else to go. He eventually managed to stop viewing Jaine as Patsy’s replacement, and they became friends. |||| Isaac later returned to Christiansboro, summoned by the sorceress Seetah, who sent him to find the Silver Surfer, but en route he was taken over by the Coroner. Overpowered and freed by the Surfer, they confronted the Coroner, who turned Isaac to stone; Seetah later made him flesh again, informing him he still had a quest to fulfill. It is unclear whether he has completed this quest or not, but he was recently seen back at Fire Lake when the Thunderbolts visited."

He possesses vast superhuman strength and a high degree of invulnerability with some resistance to cold, heat, fire, corrosives and toxins.",,"Brian Calusky was a drifter and a wanderer, often drifting into crime. While in prison at Ryer’s Island, he met and befriended Dirk Garthwaite, a.k.a. the Wrecker. The Wrecker told his friends of the power he received by Karnilla, the Norn Queen, power enough to take on the thunder god Thor, and they orchestrated an escape. With fellow convicts Dr. Eliot Franklin and Henry Camp, the four managed to retrieve the crowbar that housed the powers that had been drained from the Wrecker. Grasping the bar in an electrical storm, the Wrecker was restored, Franklin became Thunderball, Camp became Bulldozer, and Calusky became Piledriver. Together, they became known as the Wrecking Crew. |||| After their first foray against the Defenders, Piledriver and the Wrecking Crew were inseparable, appearing with them in all their endeavors, including their abduction to Battleworld by the Beyonder and joining with Doctor Doom's army of super-villains. The Crew also joined Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil and Piledriver was instrumental in helping bring down Hercules. After this, Thor used his hammer to draw the Wrecker’s away from the others who divided it, and Piledriver was left powerless. |||| |||| Months later, the Wrecker freed his Crew and restored their power once more. As before, wherever the Wrecking Crew was to be found, Piledriver was among their number. They performed many other acts of villainy, although they had to deal often with the treachery of Thunderball, who craved the Wrecker’s power all for himself. Eventually, the Crew reconciled, seeking out Hercules once more. But battling them helped Hercules overcome the fear of combat he had suffered since the beating at their hands, and they were defeated. |||| |||| Once, their powers began fading when many of Asgard's links to Earth were separated. The entire Crew received a power boost when hired by Arnim Zola to battle the Thunderbolts (unaware that the Thunderbolts included many of their former allies in the Masters of Evil). |||| |||| The Wrecking Crew appeared together for various endeavors: hired by the likes of the Doomsday Man, battling heroes such as the Avengers and the Warriors Three, used as lackeys by Morgan le Fay, among others. When the Crew was imprisoned in the Raft, they joined the massive breakout and escaped. |||| |||| When Brian recently discovered he had a long-lost son, Ricky, he and the Crew traveled to Los Angeles to induct him into the Wrecking Crew as the Excavator. This brought them to the attention of the Runaways, who had taken it upon themselves to liberate any child of a super-criminal legacy. They defeated the Crew and presumably allowed Excavator to be reunited with his family guardians."

Having been successfully given electrical abilities, Electro, as he now liked to be called, was sold into the service of the Kingpin of Crime, Wilson Fisk, in return for construction contracts for another of Hammer’s projects. Electro served Fisk willingly as an enforcer, and when Spider-Man broke into Fisk Tower, the Kingpin set his new acquisition the task of taking the intruder down, something Electro swiftly managed. Electro was subsequently present when Kingpin murdered Frederick Foswell, the underboss known as Mr. Big, for having supplied Spider-Man with information. |||| |||| |||| When Spider-Man returned to the Tower a few days later to steal the surveillance footage showing Fisk’s crime, Electro and the Enforcers were sent to stop him. Initially dodging Electro’s blasts, Spider-Man then tricked his foe into stunning Ox, one of the Enforcers. After taking down the other two Enforcers, Spider-Man grappled with Electro, then threw him in to a stream of water coming from a broken water pipe, causing the electrical criminal to short out violently. |||| |||| He awoke three weeks later in hospital to find that the Kingpin had fled the country and F.B.I. agents waiting for him to wake so they could question him as to his reasons for being in the crime lord’s basement. Electro’s killed everyone in the room and fled, but he was swiftly recaptured by Captain America, Iron Man and the Black Widow. He was imprisoned in a secure S.H.I.E.L.D. facility alongside several other genetically modified criminals (Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, Kraven and Sandman), his powers blocked by a high-tech control collar, to be studied and interrogated by Hank Pym (Giant Man). After several months, Dr Octopus engineered a break out, and the group slaughtered their way to freedom, killing 35 S.H.I.E.L.D. agents on their way out. Their next move was a direct assault on S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Triskelion main base to capture Spider-Man, who had been moved there for his own protection. Octopus breached computer security to shut down the base’s defenses, then Electro overloaded both primary and back-up generators.

Spider-man showed up, but was knocked unconscious, resulting in a battle between Venom and Electro for the life of the web-slinger.

Due to being blind, she is capable of sensing things other people can't, such as another's heartbeat or general presence",,"The laboratory explosion which blinded young Alicia Masters for life also killed her father. Her mother married her father's partner, the man who would eventually become the Puppet Master. After her mother died, Phillip Masters raised Alicia alone. |||| |||| |||| When her stepfather used his abilities to control the Fantastic Four's Thing and bring him to his apartment for revenge, Alicia sensed the presence of the Invisible Girl, allowing the Puppet Master to trap her by flooding the room with ether. With the Invisible Girl captured, her stepfather dressed Alicia up to look like her and sent her with the Thing to the Baxter Building. But when the Thing attacked his teammates, the rest of the Fantastic Four lured him into a serum that Mister Fantastic had designed to return him to his human self, which broke the Puppet Master’s control. Alicia ran to Ben, and felt his face, but though it radiated the same strength and kindness he did as the Thing, she was relieved when he quickly transformed back into his, tragic and sensitive, rocky self. |||| |||| |||| Alicia was left alone in their apartment after the Fantastic Four defeated her stepfather; afraid that he would return and force her to do things she didn’t want to. He did return, and revealed to her a puppet of himself in a king’s crown and robe. He announced that he would control the world with his puppets. But she resisted him, and in a struggle she tipped over his puppet, pushing him out of a window, seemingly to his death. Her stepfather’s apparent death was short-lived, however, and soon he returned to plague the Fantastic Four, and Alicia, for many years. Alicia quickly befriended the Thing, and they soon began a romantic relationship that also lasted many years. |||| |||| |||| When the Silver Surfer first led Galactus to Earth, the Surfer was struck temporarily unconscious by blow from the Thing. Alicia took care of the Surfer, who was touched by her compassion. This meeting with Alicia led the Surfer to realize the worth of the human race, and to betray Galactus in their defense. He later returned to her but their friendship didn't last long, as the Thing grew jealous and fought with him, believing the Surfer would win Alicia away from him. |||| |||| |||| Alicia was later kidnapped by the Enclave in order to use her blindness and skills as a sculptress to sculpt a bust of their creation, Him, as he initially gave off too much light for a sighted person to withstand. Alicia followed Dr. Hamilton into Warlock's cell, but Warlock sensed her goodness and allowed her in while he imprisoned Hamilton in living vines. She was the first person to see Warlock emerge from the cocoon which his body had surrounded him in, and was forced to stand by while he killed Hamilton and tore apart the Beehive. But the Fantastic Four soon saved her and teleported her out with them before Warlock could transport himself, as well, destroying the Beehive and killing his creators. |||| |||| |||| Over time, Alicia and Ben's relationship grew stronger, and the two considered marriage several times. However, Ben's membership in the Fantastic Four continued to put Alicia at risk and she was occasionally kidnapped or used against Ben, most notably when she mutated into a spider-monster at the hands of Hydra and she was transformed into the Egyptian bride of Nephrus. When Alicia was hospitalized after a brutal attack by Annihilus, their relationship grew troubled. Each came to the conclusion that their courtship should end, but before they could act on it, Ben was taken to the Beyonder's Battleworld and Alicia was kidnapped by Skrulls. One of the Skulls, Lyja the Lazerfirst, took Alicia's place and masqueraded as her for a long period time, starting a romance with and eventually marrying the Human Torch. When the Fantastic Four eventually rescued the real Alicia, she and Ben officially and amicably ended their romance, though they remain good friends. Her father has twice tried to manipulate their minds to reunite the pair, in Liddleville and Sunshine City, but both efforts failed. |||| |||| |||| Recently, Alicia traveled into space with Silver Surfer. To preserve her life while off planet, the alien robot Cy-phyrr 4 gifted her a suit of armor which gave her 'quantum slight' and allowed her to manipulate cosmic energy. Alicia later permanently sacrificed her armor to save the lives of Mantis and several bystanders when Galactus attempted to devour the Shi'ar homeworld. During this time, Alicia and the Surfer conducted a romantic relationship, which ended when Alicia decided to remain on Earth while Surfer wanted to return to the stars. Alicia has since returned to her career as a successful sculptor."

He has absolute control over magnetism and shows often startling prowess at manipulating all things metallic in a way that casual comic fans might today recognize as a kind of riff on the X-Men villain, Magneto.  In truth, though, this hero predates the Marvel villain by about a decade. As one of the longest-running members of the Legion, and its frequent leader, his is one of the more developed personalities. Though his personality has fluctuated in each of the major runs of the book, he is characterized with some variation, but he never strays too far from being portrayed as an essentially serious leader--a 'straight', earnest, mature figure amongst his more frivolous peers. He is frequently shown to be in an adversarial relationship with Braniac 5. He often displays fraternal respect to Lightning Lad/Live WIre and Saturn Girl. These four may be seen to be the solid leadership core of the group.

He was also capable of absorbing energy from other sources. He possessed superhuman levels of healing and endurance and could survive unprotected in space. Although he only had normal intelligence, his thinking capacity was enhanced by a scanning device which gave his thought processes the speed and efficiency of a highly advanced computer. Jack also had superhuman strength.",,"Born to a scientist father and an extraterrestrial mother, Jack Hart unknowingly developed energy abilities that threatened to consume him. His father, concealing the truth from him, developed a radioactive inhibitor called Zero Fluid, which he claimed was a new form of fuel. When Philip was slain by agents of the criminal Corporation, Jack was accidentally doused with Zero Fluid, which served as a catalyst to activate his energy powers under limited control. Developing armor to contain his energies and calling himself the Jack of Hearts (in honor of his father's love for playing cards) Jack set out to avenge his father's death. This initially brought him into conflict with several heroes including the White Tiger. After slaying his father’s murderer, Jack was taken under the wing of Iron Man and became active as a hero. When he began losing control of his power level, he turned himself in to S.H.I.E.L.D., where he was isolated and trained. |||| |||| Jack subsequently learned of his alien heritage and traveled to his mother's homeworld, Contraxia, where he re-energized the planet's dying sun. Unwilling to return to Earth, Jack remained in space for a while and was briefly captured by the Stranger and held prisoner on his Laboratory World. The Laboratory World prisoners were set free during an invasion by the Overmind and the Squadron Supreme, and Jack went back to Earth. Upon his return to Earth, Jack battled Quasar and fellow escapees the Presence and Starlight, and the Presence blew a hole in Jack's suit, causing him to retreat into space. Moondragon retrieved him from space, revived him, and mentally forced him to battle Kismet. After he escaped Moondragon's control, Jack set out for space again. |||| |||| Jack sought out the Silver Surfer‘s aid in controlling his powers and Jack received an improved set of alien armor on the Anvil prison planet where he helped the Surfer battle Nebula and Gaetar. A short time later, he was captured by the powerful Tyrant along with Thor‘s oath-brother Beta Ray Bill, the leader of the Imperial Guard, Gladiator, alien warrior woman Ganymede, and former Heralds of Galactus, the Silver Surfer, Terrax, and Morg (the latter of which was Galactus' Herald at the time). All except Morg managed to escape from Tyrant, and Jack became a close ally and lover of Ganymede. |||| |||| Later, Jack encountered a group of Avengers in space and was involved in a conflict between the Avengers and the Infinites. Jack accompanied them back to Earth, coming into conflict with the alien Ruul (who were secretly just a mutated faction of the Kree) when they plotted to turn the Earth into a prison planet for inter-galactic criminals. After this conflict, he accepted the invitation to join the Avengers. Unfortunately, remaining on Earth required him to subject himself again to periodic isolation, this time for fourteen hours a day. Growing tired of such restraints, Jack allowed himself to explode due to a buildup of his energy, but not before saving Ant-Man‘s daughter Cassandra Lang from a child-killer. He was believed to be dead for a time but apparently returned when the Scarlet Witch went insane (though his zombie-like form might have been an apparition created by the Witch) and his body exploded again, killing Scott Lang in front of the Avengers' Mansion."

His typical uses for this power has been to mold matter to his whim, disrupt matter into dust or liquid, and convert one substance into another. He also uses the power to fly and control complex machines. The full range of Reece's power remains unknown, but he was able with the help of the Silver Surfer to affect the Earth on a planet-wide scale. Originally, he limited himself to being able to affect only inorganic materials, but there truly seems to be no limit to his power. Once, he proved able to store his life force in his wand, then mentally take over anyone who handled it, even creating a new body for himself.",,"The Molecule Man started out as a lowly laboratory technician who worked at the Acme Atomic Corp. But one day, while Owen Reece was bemoaning his position in life as a nobody, a cog in the wheels of the corporation, he became distracted enough to make a mistake that would forever change his life. The atomic machine he worked on blasted him with radiation, and he survived, but the accident gave him power over the very building blocks of existence. Without even knowing his name, the head of the corporation fired him, but Owen used his newfound powers to freeze him solid, using a wand that he believed he needed to focus his powers. |||| |||| Reece then took control of the Fantastic Four’s Baxter Building, and tore it from the ground, hovering along with it over Times Square. He announced that he was taking over the city would become the only law. Even the Fantastic Four, who were asked to stop him by Uatu The Watcher, were unable to beat him, and were forced to flee in order to come up with a new plan. But Mister Fantastic soon discovered that Reece could seemingly not control organic material and enlisted the help of Alicia Masters, the Thing’s girlfriend, to cover the four in plaster and pass them off as statues. Reece came after them and tried to manipulate the statues, but the feedback from trying to affect their organic molecules caused him intense pain. Uatu then appeared and trapped him within another dimension to protect Earth from his power. |||| |||| To pass the time, Owen created a companion, using his powers to fashion a fully-conscious being that he called his son. However, Owen found that time passed at an accelerated rate in his new world and soon died of old age. Owen’s “son” took up the Molecule Man’s wand and found it contained all his power. Calling himself the new Molecule Man, the being used the wand to escape back to Earth, hoping to avenge his father. He sought out the Thing of the Fantastic Four, battling him until the Thing managed to separate him from the wand. Apparently, the wand was necessary to maintain his existence, and the new Molecule Man disintegrated. |||| |||| In fact, Owen Reece had not died, but managed to transfer his consciousness and powers into the wand his 'son' carried. He could overpower the minds of whoever touched the wand and take control of their bodies, temporarily reviving the Molecule Man each time. The wand passed through the hands of a succession of holders until the Silver Surfer happened upon it, sensing its great power. When he casually dismissed it, however, Reece's mind finally proved able to recreate his body, power and all. His encounter with the Surfer convinced Owen that he had always failed because he had no purpose beyond petty tantrums. Inspired by the Surfer’s tale, Owen decided he would devour the Earth similar to Galactus. The Surfer sent for help, and the Avengers arrived to confront him. The Avengers were easily defeated, as the Molecule Man disintegrated Captain America’s shield, Iron Man’s armor, Thor’s hammer, and even the Silver Surfer’s surfboard. Ultimately, it was Tigra who managed to talk him down, giving Owen the first heart-to-heart he had heard in years and convincing him to give himself up and seek psychiatric help. |||| |||| Owen Reece did so, and soon began seek out more conventional goals: true love, friendship, and a good home. Instead, however, the Molecule Man was abducted to Battleworld, the planet created by the Beyonder (now, the Maker), as part of the small army of criminal superhuman beings that were to engage in the first of the Secret Wars. He only joined the other supervillains after some persuasive words by Doctor Doom, and fought the assembled superheroes who were also brought to Battleworld. During the course of the war, Owen and Volcana fell in love. When Doom succeeded in stealing the power of the Beyonder for himself, Owen thought Doom had abandoned them all and confronted Doom, threatening to kill him. But Doom helped Reece realize his powers were only limited by his own sense of unworthiness--his power was greater than he had believed and could even effect organic materials. No longer angry at Doom (who eventually lost his new power), Owen used his powers to transport himself, Volcana, and most of the criminals, along with the entire portion of the city of Denver, back to Earth. |||| |||| On Earth, Owen and Volcana began a quiet life living together, and Owen took a new job as a worker in an atomic plant. This bliss was not to last, as the Beyonder returned to Earth to seek emotional fulfillment but failed, declaring he would destroy the multiverse. Owen was sought out by the assembled heroes, and he tried to destroy the Beyonder, but the Beyonder's immense power far surpassed even Owen’s own, and Owen was left exhausted. Finally, the Beyonder unleashed an immensely powerful blast of energy to destroy Owen and his allies, sufficient even to rip open Earth's crust and threaten incredible planetwide instability. The Molecule Man used his power to shield himself and his allies and remove every living thing from the path of the blast to safety, but the cost of doing so seemed to severely injure him internally. |||| |||| The Beyonder then created a complex machine to transform himself into a mortal being with his full power. The Molecule Man and his allies found the machine, and Owen, but they could not take the chance that the newly reborn Beyonder would not someday destroy the multiverse, and decided to kill him while he was incubating. Owen wrecked the machine, causing the infant's death, and diverted the Beyonder's immense power, released by the machine, into the dimension from which the Beyonder had originally come. The injured Molecule Man and the Silver Surfer, uniting their power temporarily, repaired all the damage done to the Earth. Owen then claimed his powers had been burned out, so as to once more hide away from the heroes. He returned to live quietly with Volcana in their Denver suburb. Among his allies, only Volcana and the Silver Surfer knew that Owen still had his powers. |||| |||| Months later, Owen was confronted by Kubik, a being created from the Cosmic Cube. Kubik revealed to Owen that his powers stemmed from similar energies, as did the Beyonder, who Kubik also confronted and nearly destroyed most of the Beyonder's pet reality. Kubik might have destroyed the Beyonder, but the alien Shaper of Worlds called him to stop the battle. Under the Shaper's guidance, Kubik, Molecule Man, and the Beyonder realized they shared a common origin, and the Molecule Man and Beyonder physically merged to create a new Cosmic Cube-- their powers were actually an intelligence like Kubik's that was split during the Molecule Man's origin. Owen was mutated into the Molecule Man while the remaining energy developed sentience to become the Beyonder. Kubik left with the Shaper into space to oversee the development of this new Cube, which might someday hatch a being similar to Kubik. |||| |||| Volcana, who believed Owen to be dead after merging into the Cube, was actually secretly imbued by Owen with his power moments before the transformation. She tried going through life as normal, but soon found herself exhibiting strange new aspects of her powers, due to the power of the Molecule Man within her. |||| Eventually, the Cube separated Owen’s essence from his power, rejected him and returned him to Earth, powerless. Volcana soon stumbled upon Owen, who was living in squalor at his old apartment. He knew he was powerless and felt it better to live in anonymity than to have nothing to offer his true love. Before they could make up, the criminal organization A.I.M., which had been tracking Volcana due to her power fluctuations, attacked the two through their agent Klaw. Reece's powers, within her, evolved to allow her to wish his powers returned to him. Now once again the Molecule Man, Owen quickly defeated Klaw, but Volcana would not return to him, seeing him as a bully and too dependant on his power to attempt to try a relationship. Owen left her, still professing his love and vowing to prove it to her someday."

294,Wonder Woman (DC)(Earth-1 - Pre Crisis)(01- Diana),Diana Prince ,294_20051121225343_char.jpg,,,"This version of Wonder Woman might be said to have not existed, as well, and certainly a number of her adventures are properly assigned to Hippolyta, from a post-Crisis perspective. |||| |||| It is this version of Wonder Woman that went through the most profound changes.  She went from being a fairly bland (read: safe) version of herself that really had a lot in common with the animated Super Friends version.  She was all about super powers and kickin' ass, with just a pinch of her Amazonian legacy thrown in.  By the early-mid 70s, though, she had abandoned the uniform and powers entirely, and adopted a role much closer to a secret agent.  She studied with a martial arts expert, took a job as the proprietor of a hip clothing store, and wasn't seen for a couple of years in her Wonder Woman outfit.  This era drew criticism, though, so she regained her powers and went on a 2-year quest to be returned to active duty in the JLA.  No sooner had she endured her trials when the Wonder Woman title started telling Earth 2 Wonder Woman stories, in deference to the setting of the Wonder Woman TV show.  When the show, in its later seasons, returned to the present, the comic returned to Earth 1, and the newly-JLA-reinstated Wonder Woman. |||| |||| During the Crisis , Diana was thought to have been killed.  However, as the Pérez run would make clear, she hadn't been killed, but sent back in time. |||| |||| And this , out of all of Wonder Woman's adventures, is where it gets weird. |||| |||| Somehow, in a way not adequately explained, she wasn't just thrown back in time.  She was actually devolved to the day she'd been formed of clay.  In other words, the Crisis affected her in a way substantially differently than it did any other character in the DCU.  Wonder Woman II and Wonder Woman III are the same person, but neither has knowledge of the other.  We speak of 'reboots' frequently in assessing the history of comic books, but it's never been so literally true as perhaps it was with Wonder Woman. |||| |||| What's unfortunate about this method of reinventing the character is that, far from making her history 'simpler', as was the intended effect of the Crisis , it makes it much more complicated.  Had she been a part of the normal 'Crisis effect'--that is, had she been reset precisely as the rest of the DCU--her story would've just started at whatever point the writers wanted to set. But in drawing this link between pre- and post- Crisis Diana, and in demonstrating that she actually 'devolved' from one to the other, she confusingly becomes a 'non-surviving survivor' of Crisis on Infinite Earths . |||| For a discussion of this character's costume evolution, please click here"
