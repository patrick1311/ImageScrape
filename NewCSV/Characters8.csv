1698,Grey Gargoyle (Marvel),Paul Pierre Duval ,1698_20070126030630_char.jpg,"Duval's superhuman power is the ability to transform any object or person into stone with the touch of his right hand. The power works on people and the clothing they wear, although it would only affect a battlesuit, not its wearer. If two people were holding hands and Duval touched only one of them, only the one he touched would be affected. He must wear specially treated gloves when he does not want to access his power. |||| |||| By touching himself with his right hand, Duval transforms himself into a living statue of stone, and seems capable of remaining in that form indefinitely. In this form, Duval has a stone-like skin providing him superhuman strength and resistance to injury, even against the rigors of deep space, and does not need to eat or breath while transformed. Duval has also shown the ability to scale stone and brick walls by touch.",,"Paul Pierre Duval, a young chemist working for a pharmaceutical company in Paris, accidentally spilled a potion contaminated by some unknown organic substance on his right hand. To his dismay, his hand began to turn to stone-like material still capable of movement. Accidentally touching his other hand, he found that he could transform his entire body into the stone-like material. He also discovered that any matter he touched also turned to stone. Mercenary by nature, Duval decided to exploit his bizarre power for personal profit and turned to theft, quickly becoming one of France’s most accomplished criminals as the Grey Gargoyle. |||| |||| The Grey Gargoyle, bored with lack of challenge to his crimes, decided to travel to America and wrest the secret of immortality from Thor. He was twice bested in combat by him before returning to what had proved more successful in the past-- pure mercenary endeavors. His first attempt was to steal a new cobalt-powered weapon from Stark Industries, and he was actually successful after transforming Iron Man’s battle armor to stone. Iron Man returned when the Gargoyle’s power wore off, stopping the villain by destroying the machinery he hoped to abscond with. Later, an attempted to acquire the deadly compound dubbed 'Element X' went horribly wrong. He was confronted by Captain America, the Falcon, and Nick Fury, cornered, and accidentally shot into space. |||| |||| The Gargoyle found himself trapped aboard a satellite in Earth’s orbit, where the subversive scientific organization Advanced Idea Mechanics rescued him. On their behalf, he joined their efforts to launch a satellite with heavy weaponry, fighting Captain America and Spider-Man, but was accidentally rocketed into space once more. In deep space, he was retrieved by the Bird of Prey, a pirate starship whose crew members were of various alien races. Ever out for himself, the Grey Gargoyle forced himself into command of the ship. |||| |||| The Bird of Prey encountered the starship StarJammer, used by Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three in their adventure to the Doomsday Star. The Gargoyle had the heroes captured and conscripted to join the crew for slave labor. The heroes’ ally, the Recorder, not only helped his friends escape but started a mutiny among the crew against the Grey Gargoyle. When the rebellion grew out of control, the Grey Gargoyle professed to want to join Thor in order to return to Earth. However, at the height of the battle, the Gargoyle tried to flee and seemed to have died in a violent explosion. |||| |||| In fact, Duval survived by created a stone-like cocoon around himself. Using the cocoon to travel through space, he managed to return to Earth, where he immediately battled the Avengers. In the process, his cocoon was destroyed, and he was taken into police custody. Duval was soon freed by villains of the fourth Masters of Evil organization, whose goal was to destroy the Avengers, but following a defeat at the hands of the Wasp and Black Knight, he was again returned to jail. |||| |||| Having broken out, Duval embarked on a unique plan. He created an artistic persona, Paul St. Pierre, and became a successful and highly sought-after sculptor. In fact, his statues were real people, transformed by his power and sealed with a special polymer compound that would make this change permanent. His plot was uncovered when Tony Stark attended his gallery, and he exposed the Gargoyle. |||| |||| The Grey Gargoyle was broken out of prison again, this time to join several master criminals in a coordinated attack on various heroes and sent to battle the Hulk. At the time, the Hulk possessed a gray alter-ego, and this confused Duval, who had thought that the Hulk had turned to stone but nonetheless kept moving. The Hulk summarily defeated the Gargoyle, breaking his arm, and left. The Grey Gargoyle continued to be a recurring villain in the lives of many heroes, battling the likes of Captain America and Spider-Man as part of Doctor Doom’s “Doom’s Brigade,” fighting She-Hulk, and being accosted by the Black Widow. In the latter case, the Widow claimed a self-appointed mission to track down and destroy all of the Avengers’ former enemies, and she seemed to obliterate the Grey Gargoyle, blasting his stone form into pieces. |||| |||| Later, Duval, somehow recovering from his previous encounter, was contacted by the Gideon Trust, a business executive board interested in using technology developed by the Fantastic Four for their own purposes. They bade the Grey Gargoyle to attack the Thing, in a sort of initiation to their employ. The Gargoyle seemed successful in turning the Thing into non-living stone, but he was defeated by the remaining members of the Fantastic Four. In addition, the Thing was able to break free of the Gargoyle’s power as it kick-started his ability to transform into his human alter-ego and back again at will. |||| |||| Paul Duval returned to his initial goal of searching for Thor’s secret to immortality when the death of a childhood friend affected him significantly. He attacked Thor Girl, Thor’s associate Tarene, and actually managed to defeat her, leaving her for dead and stealing her magical hammer. Proclaiming himself to now be like a god, the Gargoyle was immediately confronted by Desak the God-Slayer who was searching for Thor. Desak defeated the Gargoyle with ease. |||| |||| He was next seen serving time at Pym Experimental Penitentiary Number One, a prison that kept its super-powered inmates miniaturized, and participated in a breakout led by the Mad Thinker only to be thwarted by She-Hulk."

5813,Psycho-Man (Marvel),,5813_20151124094754_char.jpg,"Psycho-Man usually depended on armor and weapons. He has sometimes stated that he derives power from the emotions he causes, like a psychic vampire. He recently gained some of the powers of his Control Box, as well as the ability to generate solid energy forms to give substance to his illusions. |||| |||| Psycho-Man wears a variety of body armors (or uses robot-versions of himself), demonstrating superhuman physical powers; some are giant-sized or possess other offensive powers. He traveled throughout the Microverse in an immense World Ship, and has the means to travel to and from Earth or other dimensions. He has created androids able to pass as human, alter their appearances, and manipulate emotions. |||| |||| Psycho-Man has great intelligence and mathematical genius, as well as extensive knowledge of technology far in advance of present-day Earth's.",,"The Chief Scientist and ruler of the technocracy governing the five planets of the Sub-Atomica system within the Microverse (a reality accessed via the energies of shrinking), Psycho-Man discovered the secrets of fear itself with the guidance of the Earth goddess Nox. When his system became overcrowded, he sought a new home for his people and chose Earth, whose population he believed had no defense against his weaponry. He created a human-sized armored suit and Control Box. Unable to transport a weapon large enough to affect the entire planet, he employed several criminals whom he kept in line via his Control Box-Ivan, Live Wire, and Shell-Shock-successfully gathering the materials to construct his large Control weapon. However, the land he used as his base had been recently purchased as Panther Island by the Black Panther. With the help of the Inhumans, the Black Panther fought with him and bested his partners. Then, with the appearance of the Human Torch, Thing, Triton, and Lockjaw, they fought him directly, but were stalled by his massive psycho ray that kept them at bay with their greatest fears. But Gorgon arrived moments later and discovered the ruse and helped his friends escape and destroy the gun; and in a final battle, the Black Panther snuck up behind Psycho-Man and grabbed him, where-in he disappeared again into the Microverse. |||| |||| Shortly thereafter, the Human Torch, Thing, and Mister Fantastic entered the Microverse seeking the Silver Surfer to prevent Galactus from consuming Earth. Detecting their presence, Psycho-Man sent his Indestructible robot to capture them, but the Silver Surfer wiped it from existence before returning to Earth. Psycho-Man then transported the Fantastic Four members aboard his ship and sent a number of armored forms against them; however, the heroes trapped Psycho-Man and convinced him that Galactus posed a threat to his world as well, and he returned them to Earth. Soon after, Sub-Atomica was overrun by the invading Insectivorids of Annihilus. Psycho-Man captured the Surfer to power his energy weapons and Spider-Man to probe his mind for the means of driving off the insect swarm, but they escaped back to Earth. Annihilus was eventually driven off. |||| |||| Apparently exiled by his people, Psycho-Man retreated to his Worldship, employing androids to clear space debris around him. Though remaining a man of science, he came to worship gods of Chaos. Psycho-Man also reclaimed his armor from the Fantastic Four, which led them to pursue him back to the Microverse. Meanwhile, Arcturus Rann and the Micronauts were attacked by his androids and followed them back to Psycho-Man's ship. There the teams joined forces to thwart Psycho-Man's plot to conquer the universe, though the Microversian Insectivorid, Jasmine, was slain by one of Psycho-Man's creatures. |||| |||| Psycho-Man later easily conquered Mirwood, the Microverse planet of Princess Pearla, seeking to seize the metal from its Mines of Nuvidia, which provided immunity to his emotion-control. He then returned to Earth, using an artificial being as his Hate-Monger, fanning bigotry and hatred into violent chaos across New York City, and transforming the Invisible Girl into his pawn Malice, Mistress of Hate. The Hate-Monger was destroyed by the villain-killing Scourge of the Underworld, and the Fantastic Four restored Malice to her right mind. The Fantastic Four pursued Psycho-Man to Mirwood where, despite being initially captured and duped into believing they had been trapped at tiny size, they overpowered him. Confronting her tormentor, Sue Richards usurped his Control Box, subjecting him to all three emotions at maximum intensity, leaving him a withered husk and collapsing his autonomic nervous system. Allegedly requiring artificial support to survive, he sent a robot duplicate to Earth some time later, but it was easily defeated by Fantastic Four clones created by Aron the Rogue Watcher. Psycho-Man then managed to shrink the entire Sub-Atomica system and held it hostage on his worldship until they acknowledged him as their ruler again. Lacking the power to restore the system to true size, he sought out the cosmic Uni-Power (briefly granted to beings to become Captain Universe), summoning Spider-Man and a number of its other past possessors to the Microverse. Finding Spider-Man and the rest bereft of those energies, Psycho-Man imprisoned them, but they broke free; subjected to an overload of his own shrink-ray by Spider-Man, Psycho-Man vanished from existence. |||| |||| After the apparent death of Mr. Fantastic, Psycho-Man plotted vengeance against the Invisible Woman, reconquering Mirwood and using Pearla to dupe the Fantastic Four into believing that Mr. Fantastic was in the Microverse. The Fantastic Four's newest member, Ant-Man (Scott Lang), exposed Psycho-Man's involvement, and the seemingly invalid villain blew up his own base in an effort to slay his foes, though they escaped. Surviving as well, Psycho-Man occupied the facilities of Baron Karza, a Microverse tyrant then believed dead. Psycho-Man sought the future technology of the cyborg Garrison Kane (Weapon X) to enhance the power of the Baron's Dog Soldiers, leading to a conflict with Kane's allies Cable, Domino (Neena Thurman), and Copycat, as well as Arcturus Rann, Marionette, and Bug. Cable used his psychic powers to bombard Psycho-Man with the powerful love emotions existing between Kane and Copycat, incapacitating the villain, who was left in stasis under the Rann's' supervision. |||| |||| When the Stark-Fujikawa Corporation somehow acquired one of Psycho-Man's armored suits and Control Boxes, Dr. Bradley Beynon used them to seek vengeance on Reed Richards, whom Beynon felt had stolen his ideas. The real Psycho-Man confronted him to retrieve his property, but both he and Beynon were sent back to the Microverse by a malfunctioning shrink ray. When the Silver Surfer pursued the extradimensional Tenebrae into the Microverse, Psycho-Man captured them both. The Surfer broke free, but Psycho-Man then joined with Tenebrae to capture the Silver Surfer and use him to power his ship as they plotted to conquer Earth; however, Tenebrae's former associates in the group-mind of the Mergence attacked them, and Psycho-Man narrowly escaped back to his own realm. When Sub-Atomica's existence appeared to be threatened by energies from Earth, Psycho-Man traced them back to the young mutant Hope (Esperanza Ling), and he attempted to claim her power for himself. Hope was protected by Spider-Man, the alien Technarch Warlock, and the telepath Psimon, so Psycho-Man transported them back to his ship where his more powerful weapon nearly drove them all mad. The panicked Hope's technology-disrupting power nearly destroyed his ship, and Psycho-Man was forced to admit defeat and send the heroes home. |||| |||| Shortly thereafter, all of the Microverse-type realms were merged during a conflict between the mad Titan Thanos and the revived Baron Karza. Around that time, Fredd, the alternate-dimension evil twin clone future self of Captain Marvel (Genis-Vell), was banished from his reality in an energy cocoon by his world's Reed Richards. He arrived in the Microverse, where his power was detected by Psycho-Man, who enlisted Drax the Destroyer to shatter the cocoon. Once freed, Fredd proved immune to the power of Psycho-Man, whom he dominated, and he captured Earth-616 (mainstream Earth)'s Captain Marvel to test Psycho-Man's enlarging ray's ability to restore him to Earth. Captain Marvel took control of Fredd's Nega-Bands and tapped into Psycho-Man's Control Box, driving Fredd into a frenzy that culminated with his exploding Psycho-Man's World Ship. |||| Psycho-Man finally began to succumb to the nerve degeneration initiated by Sue Richards' attack. Dying, he returned to Earth to gain vengeance on his greatest enemies. His powers enhanced to a new degree, he caused the Fantastic Four to be evicted from the Baxter Building, taking it as his own base. From there he spread his power across Manhattan, causing increasing levels of terror, violence, and depression. Sue, however, was able not only to sense his power, but to manipulate his energies, purging the city of them. Using the blind Alicia Masters as a double to catch Psycho-Man unaware, Sue knocked him out by obstructing his airway, and he was placed in stasis."

80832,Loni Stane (Marvel)(Earth-55921),,,,,"Loni was a greedy opportunist, always on the lookout for a man who could provide her with a life of wealth and privilege. She found such a man in industrialist Howard Stark. The two were married and they remained together until Howard's company, the Stark Defense Corporation, began suffering financially. This was due largely to Howard's investment in Biotech Armor, whose untested processes caused Stark's stock to plummet. Fearing for her future, Loni divorced Stark and took half of his assets in the settlement and then began sleeping with Zebediah Stane, Stark's chief competitor. Loni (being a gold digger) agreed with Stane in taking Stark's company apart (Howard was most likely too distracted as his second wife gave birth their son). Later, Loni had her and Stane's son. |||| |||| After Stane was sent to prison for kidnapping Stark's young son, Loni divorced Stane and acquired even more money from the settlement. Sometime later, she meets a teenage Tony Stark and his friend James Rhodes as well as seeing the younger Stark's prototype armor. She later pleaded with her ex-husband to provide Obadiah Stane (her son) with a secure education via a stay at the government think tank known as the Baxter Building. |||| |||| Later, Tony thinks it was Loni that's the mastermind behind the scenes trying to kill them and set off to Utah to find Loni. When they arrive, Obadiah falls off a cliff but Tony (in his prototype Iron Man armor) catches him as terrorists arrive on the scene. Tony flees, but follows them as they take Obadiah to Loni and their hideout. When Tony breaks into the compound, Loni floods it with poison gas trying to kill him, abandoning Obadiah. Stark saves Obadiah, but Howard and Nifara are taken captive by Loni. After killing Nifara and the guards (because she wanted no witnesses), Loni confesses to the elder Stark that all she ever wanted was power. That’s why she married Howard, divorced him, married Zebadiah, had Obadiah, and later had Zebadiah killed. |||| |||| Tony shows up, and Loni shoots Howard in the chest, threatening to shoot him again if he doesn't take the suit off. After Tony takes off his armor, Loni says she wondered what it was like if she stayed with Howard, had given him a child, and if she had been Tony's mother. Then, Loni shoots him in the head, not knowing that his entire body is a brain and will heal itself. Tony fights Loni, beats her, and tends to Howard. Obadiah, mad that Loni (his mother) abandoned him for dead with the poison gas, enters the room and kills her."
9609,Ringer (Marvel)(01 - Anthony Davis),Anthony Davis ,9609_20070302020059_char.jpg,,,"A former engineer for NASA, criminal Anthony Davis grew jealous of the wealthy Kyle Richmond. Designing a suit of battle armor that would be constructed by the Tinkerer, Davis, calling himself the Ringer, broke into one of Richmond's buildings to rob it. Richmond confronted the Ringer in his guise of Nighthawk II, breaking several of Davis's teeth in the process. Davis was arrested and jailed, where it took a prison dentist several weeks to rebuild his broken teeth. |||| |||| Humiliated by his defeat at Nighthawk's hands, Davis decided he was not cut out for a life of crime. He had previously designed an improved version of his old battlesuit, which remained in the Tinkerer's warehouse, which he planned to rent out to various criminal contacts as part of a get-rich-quick scheme. As Davis tested the suit, the Beetle broke into the shop to retrieve his own equipment. Easily subduing the Ringer, the Beetle brought him back to his hideout, where he forced Davis to wear the suit to battle Spider-Man, tricking him into thinking a new Ring the Beetle had added to the suit would explode if the Ringer did not obey. the Ringer teamed up with Coachwhip and Killer Shrike to attack the Moon Knight during the Acts of Vengeance, but he was defeated quickly. |||| |||| The Ringer, deathly afraid of battling another superhero, was dealt a humiliating defeat by Spider-Man, who broke his repaired dental work and left him webbed for the police. Upon his release from prison, the Ringer avoided New York City and its super heroes and operated as a costumed criminal primarily in the Midwest, sinking into petty crime and being viewed as a loser in the supervillain community. On a visit to the Bar With No Name in Medina County, Ohio, one of a number of similar secret meeting places for costumed criminals, the Ringer was contacted by Gary Gilbert, who was formerly the costumed terrorist called Firebrand. Gilbert invited the Ringer to attend a meeting at the bar to discuss strategies for dealing with Scourge, the mysterious vigilante who had murdered a large number of costumed criminals. The Ringer came to the meeting, but, unfortunately for him, so did Scourge, disguised as the bartender. Scourge slaughtered the Ringer and all the other criminals who were present. |||| |||| Upon hearing of his supposed death, the Ringer's wife Leila Davis became a criminal herself, plotting to get revenge on the Beetle, who she blamed for her husband's humiliation, although she was thwarted by Spider-Man. When she joined a group of other villains in attempting to kill the wall-crawler, she was saved during the battle by her husband, who appeared as the cyborg Strikeback. Davis revealed that he had not actually died in the Scourge's massacre, but was barely alive when AIM agents investigated the murder, seeking information on the technology used by the dead criminals. AIM created a new cyborg body for him, and he worked for the organization for some time before striking out on his own. As Strikeback, Davis was a much more skilled fighter than he was as the Ringer, defeating Boomerang, Swarm, the Vulture and Stegron. However, the dinosaur man badly damaged Strikeback's cybernetic systems during the battle, which caused them to slowly break down. During this time, he enjoyed a happy, if brief, retirement with Leila before dying. Leila herself would later perish in battle with the villain Graviton."

Hussar was one of eight Imperial Guardsmen chosen to battle the team of superhuman Earthling mutants known as the X-Men over the fate of Phoenix, a primal force of the cosmos that had assumed the form of the X-Man Jean Grey. |||| |||| Hussar was later amongst those Imperial Guard members who allied themselves with the treacherous Shi'ar High Council member Lord Samédàr who was aiding an attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by Deathbird. Even after the ploy was discovered, Hussar, like most of the other Guard members present, still chose to side with Samédàr against the X-Men who were defending then-Empress Lilandra. |||| |||| Later, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne, Hussar was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as Excalibur and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named Rachel Summers. |||| |||| Much later, during the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires, Hussar was amongst a small contingent of the Imperial Guard that defended Lilandra, who had since regained the throne, against the Kree super-team known as Starforce. Hussar was also amongst those Imperial Guard members who defended Lilandra against an assassination attempt by the Kree Ronan the Accuser and his unwilling agents, the royal family of the Earth race known as the Inhumans. |||| |||| Following a meeting of the intergalactic council, Earth was declared a threat to the entire cosmos and consequently it was deemed to turn the planet into an intergalactic prison. Criminals from numerous alien races were teleported to Earth, among them the former Imperial Guard members who had allied themselves with Deathbird and Lord Samédàr all those years ago. These former Guardsmen had allied themselves with a lone member of the alien D'bari, calling himself Starhammer, who sought revenge on Jean Grey for the crimes of Dark Phoenix."
11521,Taurus (Marvel)(04 - Female LMD),,11521_20070317225536_char.jpg,,,"The version of the Taurus LMD was previously the 2nd male version of the Taurus LMD, and was redesigned by Scorpio using the Zodiac Key. See Taurus (02 - 2nd Male LMD) for previous bio. |||| |||| At some point the android Zodiac captured and presumably killed the human Scorpio, Jacques LaPoint. Jacob Fury's Scorpio android then impersonated him and infiltrated the original, human Zodiac organization. He arranged the ambush in which the android Zodiac killed all of the remaining human Zodiac leaders except Cornelius van Lunt, alias Taurus. It was later revealed the Libra had also survived the attack on the original Zodiac Cartel. |||| |||| Immediately afterward, Van Lunt sought out the services of the Avengers' West Coast branch to confront and defeat the android Zodiac. In their initial foray, the Avengers failed, although several androids were destroyed. Sagittarius, in particular, was destroyed and replaced with an LMD replica of the Avengers’ Hawkeye. Hawkeye's LMD was used to infiltrate the Avengers' headquarters, and Scorpio also made a Leo LMD in the form of the Avengers’ Tigra for additional infiltration. This new Leo LMD helped the Zodiac gain an upper hand when the Avengers tracked the Zodiac to their refuge in Death Valley, California, but the first android Leo took offence at being replaced. He battled Scorpio directly, seemingly destroying him. |||| |||| The Zodiac Key immediately resurrected the Scorpio LMD. Claiming superiority and believing that the Zodiac would eventually kill the Avengers as the androids could never be stopped, Scorpio wanted to use the Key to transport everyone on the scene to the Key's native dimension where the conflict, he believed, could be prolonged indefinitely. However, when the androids were in the other dimension, they ceased to function because each of them were aligned with a particular zodiacal energy, energy that did not exist in the other dimension. The Avengers found Hawkeye and Tigra had been sent to the same dimension and, reunited, the team was sent back to Earth by the Brotherhood. However, secretly the Brotherhood waited so that someday they could also send the Key to Earth again and create new conflicts for them."

Unlike the true cesta, which is designed to catch and hurl a hard rubber ball, Overthrow's own metallic cesta generates glowing balls of explosive energy which he can hurl over great distances with pinpoint accuracy.  When not in use, Overthrow's cesta flips back to become part of his gauntlet.",,"Arnold Beck was an embittered employee let go from Kord Omniversal (the corporation run by Ted Kord, the Blue Beetle) who came to believe that he was just a victim of the machinations of the military-industrial complex, of which Kord's company was a prime element. He acquired a power-suit of armor, and a stylized weapon resembling a cesta-punta used in the game of jai alai which hurled explosives, and set about to demolish Kord's main facilities; this naturally brought him into conflict with the Blue Beetle, who handily defeated him. |||| |||| During the Millennium Affair, which saw a Guardian of the Universe and a Zamaron journey to Earth to help ten human beings become agents of evolutionary change, the intergalactic group known as the Manhunters threw all of its efforts into ending their program and neutralizing Earth's heroes from providing any assistance. Dozens of heroes found themselves confronted by loved ones, friends, employees, and allies who revealed themselves to be secret Manhunters who had reported back to their superiors over the years on their target's activities. Unusually, no such act of betrayal had struck the Blue Beetle, and he began to vigorously seek out just who 'his' Manhunter might be. He at first suspected that a corrupt Hub City police captain who had been blackmailing him with the knowledge of his secret identity was the Manhunter assigned to him, but this turned out to be merely a coincidental act; the Beetle was then confronted by Overthrow, who revealed himself to be the Manhunter assigned to report on him and neutralize him, if necessary. It had been the Manhunters who had provided Beck with his armor and helped him create the Overthrow identity, and on their orders he had attempted to contain and impede the Blue Beetle's activities. Beetle once again defeated Overthrow, however, and after the complete and utter defeat of Earth's Manhunters by the combined heroes of Earth (in which battle Overthrow also fought on the Manhunters' behalf) he disappeared. |||| |||| Overthrow was for some time living in the 'supervillain' nation of Zandia, the former desmesne of Brother Blood's Church of Blood. Overthrow was part of Zandia's Olympic team, which was made up largely of supervillains. |||| |||| During the events of the OMAC Project, Overthrow was in Moscow battling Rocket Red Dimitri Pushkin, the former JLI/JLE member. (Pushkin's predecessor in the JLI, Rocket Red #7 Vladimir Mikoyan, had been one of Beck's fellow Manhunters, who had revealed himself to the League and was destroyed in battle with them.) He was then targeted by the new head of Checkmate, Maxwell Lord. Lord dispatched an OMAC to attack Overthrow, and the cyborg swiftly cut the supervillain down, killing him."

1275,Galactus (Marvel),Galan ,1275_20060316175911_char.jpg,,"It can be argued that with such staggering might and vast intellect, Galactus is prone to over-confidence and underestimation of his foes, as he has often been defeated by lesser beings. |||| ||||","Rebirth |||| Originally named Galan of the planet Taa, Galactus is the sole survivor of the Big Crunch of the universe that existed prior to the current Marvel Universe. |||| |||| Galan was a space explorer investigating the impending end of his universe. His original intent was to discover a means to protect his planet from radiation that was destroying all life in the universe, but he was unable to do so. Eventually, most of Taa was engulfed and rendered dead. As Galan approached the Cosmic Egg, the focal point of the Big Crunch and the source of the life-destroying radiation, his ship and crew were promptly destroyed. At the moment Galan's universe met its end, the incarnation of that reality's Phoenix Force amassed the positive emotions of all living beings in the cosmos to preserve them from eternal damnation, enabling the Sentience of the Universe — the previous universe's incarnation of Eternity — to meet with Galan. Within the Cosmic Egg the Sentience of the Universe revealed itself to Galan and informed him that though they both would die in the impending cataclysm, they would survive through a joint heir born into the next universe. The Sentience of the Universe then merged itself with the mortal Galan, establishing Galan as the sole survivor of the ensuing Big Crunch. This union ultimately led to his rebirth in the current universe as Galactus. |||| |||| After the Big Bang of the current universe, to complete his metamorphosis, Galactus was encased in a cocoon of enormous cosmic energies. After millions of years, he emerged as an entity of vast cosmic power who was also necessary for the existence of the newly formed universe. |||| |||| Galactus is considered one of the five essential entities within the Marvel Universe alongside Eternity, Death, Infinity, and Oblivion. Galactus has been referred to as the 'third force of the universe' and 'one corner of that great triangle which is the universe' by Eternity and Death, respectively. Eternity and Death each consider Galactus a peer and a sibling, with Death actually referring to Galactus as 'husband, father, brother, and son.' |||| |||| |||| The Devourer of Worlds |||| Galactus requires unknown energies obtainable only from certain types of planets in order to sustain his life. The suitable type of planet need not be one where life is present, but it must have the potential to support life. Galactus usually employs a herald to scout the universe for those suitable types of planets. When the suitable planet is found, Galactus will usually land on the planet's surface and assemble his Elemental Converter, a colossal machine capable of draining all life energy from the planet within minutes. Galactus has been known to devour planets without the aid of his Elemental Converter on occasion, but the device makes the process more efficient. Galactus, seeing himself as a higher being, usually will not avoid a suitable planet simply because it is home to sentient life. Thus, over billions of years he has become one of the most feared beings in the universe, his vast power allowing him to lay waste to innumerable extra-terrestrial civilizations in his quest for sustenance. |||| |||| Nevertheless, he is not an evil being, but rather a force of nature whose feedings are necessary for survival. It is known that Galactus plays a necessary role in the continuum of the Marvel Universe, bringing balance between the two opposing universal forces of Death and Eternity; who are in essence the Yin and Yang of the Marvel universe. Eternity has stated that the universe would fail, falling into stasis then collapsing without Galactus' presence to balance it. It has been suggested by some that his purpose in the universe is to devour planets that have reached an evolutionary peak, although alternative information suggests that he will create a whole new universe at the end of this one, a universe which will be immeasurably greater than the total of the planets he has devoured; thus giving back far more than he has ever taken. |||| |||| |||| Heralds |||| Galactus has appointed a number of entities as his heralds, imbuing them with a minuscule portion of his Power Cosmic and sending them to search for edible worlds. Most of his heralds have either rebelled against him, betrayed him or been cast aside for some reason. |||| |||| Among his heralds are the Fallen One, Silver Surfer, Terrax, Firelord, Air-Walker, the Air-Walker robot, an Earthwoman named Frankie Raye later known as Nova, Morg, Red Shift, the Asgardian Destroyer armor, Human Torch, and Stardust. Gladiator and Tyrant were possibly heralds. |||| |||| In stories in alternate and parallel realities, Galactus also used other heralds: Plasma, Dark Angel, Superman, Dazzler, Golden Oldie, the Fantastic Four, Thor, Ardina, Starglow and Dominas. |||| |||| In the Ultimate Marvel storyline Gah Lak Tus, as he is known in the Ultimate Universe, has used the Ultimate version of the Silver Surfer as a herald as well. The ultimate version of the Vision was built as a warning system for the coming of Gah Lak Tus. |||| |||| |||| Attempts to Devour the Earth |||| Galactus has threatened to destroy the Earth on several occasions. On the first, the Fantastic Four (aided by the Watcher Uatu and by Galactus' rebellious herald, the Silver Surfer) defeated him by threatening him with the Ultimate Nullifier. Galactus vowed to never again try to harm the Earth. |||| |||| Nevertheless, he has returned on several occasions, in one instance weakened enough for the Fantastic Four, the Avengers and Doctor Strange to defeat him. Rather than watch him die of hunger, Mister Fantastic saved him, for which Galactus called him 'friend,' and vowed Earth need never again fear Galactus, and for which Mr Fantastic was later put on galactic trial by the Shi'Ar. |||| |||| |||| Temporary Death |||| In the Galactus: The Devourer limited series (1999-2000), Galactus — starving to death due to his addiction to the life forces of living beings which offer him no sustenance — was seemingly killed after a battle against the united forces of the Silver Surfer, Avengers, Fantastic Four, Jean Grey, Starjammers, the Shi'ar Empire and an armada of other united planets (including even a Kree starship) when his own Elemental Converter was turned against him. He died with an ominous warning that his death would allow a great evil to surface. After his death, Galactus' true form was revealed, that of a sentient star. |||| |||| That great evil emerged in Fantastic Four Annual 2001 in the form of Abraxas, the universal embodiment of destruction and the antithesis of Eternity. It was revealed that most of the energy that Galactus takes from planets was devoted to keeping him imprisoned. If released, Abraxas would eventually destroy the entire multiverse. Abraxas was defeated only after it was revealed in Fantastic Four (vol. 2) #49 (vol. 1) #478; January 2002) that Galactus was not truly dead but in his incorporeal star form he would be forever unable to rein in his energies and reclaim form. Franklin Richards and Valeria Von Doom pooled their vast, Celestial-level powers and reconstituted Galactus, but permanently burned out their powers in the revival. Once reconstituted, Galactus easily reclaimed the Ultimate Nullifier from Abraxas and Reed Richards used it to remake the multiverse into one in which Abraxas never escaped. It was in this issue that the Ultimate Nullifier was revealed to be an aspect of Galactus himself. |||| |||| |||| 'Rising Storm' |||| In the 2005 Fantastic Four storyline Rising Storm, Reed Richards built a weapon that was designed to strip Galactus of the Power Cosmic - this was made possible due to input from Johnny Storm who was cosmically aware at the time. Johnny Storm, as Invisible Man - Herald of Galactus, managed to keep Galactus occupied long enough for Reed and Quasar to complete construction of the weapon. The weapon actually succeeded in separating the two aspects that comprise Galactus, thus Galan was freed from the Power Cosmic and reduced to his mortal, humanoid form. In tribute to 'the indomitable spirit of the humanoid order', Galan willingly exiled himself into an other-universal realm, with the hope that this act would delay the Power Cosmic in finding him. |||| |||| This did not last long, however, and as Galactus, he encountered Beta Ray Bill in the Stormbreaker mini-series shortly after. The manner in which the Power Cosmic found Galan and reformed Galactus was never revealed. |||| |||| |||| Annihilation |||| In the Annihilation: Silver Surfer miniseries, written by Keith Giffen, it was revealed that Galactus was not always the sole member of the 'Cosmic Balance'; it has been suggested that Galactus was but one of several beings similar to himself. Due to differing opinions of the powers they had been blessed with, the Balance all but destroyed itself in civil war, with only three remaining - Galactus the Devourer of Worlds, Tenebrous of the Darkness Between, and Aegis the Lady of All Sorrows. Able to subdue his darker brethren in the first Kyln, Galactus remained the only extant member of the Balance, until the Annihilation Wave ruptured the Crunch, freeing Tenebrous and Aegis. Knowing of their escape, Galactus has augmented the Silver Surfer, who is in his employ as Herald once more, and has stated that Tenebrous and Aegis will move against him, indicating awareness. In Annihilation #1, Tenebrous and Aegis seemingly defeat the Silver Surfer and Galactus. In the subsequent issue, the incapacitated Galactus and Silver Surfer are revealed as captives in Thanos' starship, where Annihilus has tasked Thanos with discovering the secret of the Power Cosmic. Annihilation #3 finds Galactus in an unconscious state, while Thanos has harnessed Galactus' cosmic might to utilize him as a weapon of destruction on a large scale. In Annihilation #4, Thanos attempts to release Galactus from his bonds, as the Titan discovers that Annihilus plans to use Galactus as a cosmic bomb to destroy all life in both the 616-universe and the Negative Zone. As he works to free Galactus, Thanos remarks that he would teleport away once the planet eater was released, as he would not want to be on the receiving end of devourer's wrath. However, Thanos meets an untimely end at the hands of Drax the Destroyer before he can release Galactus. ||||"

However, a mobster threw a grenade into the room, killing the witness and blinding McNider. McNider thought his days as a surgeon were over until one day, as he was recovering, an owl crashed through his window (remeniscent of the incident that inspired Batman to dress as a bat). Taking off the bandages that were covering his eyes, he found that he could see, but only in perfect darkness. Using his newfound ability, he developed a special visor that let him see in light and 'blackout bombs' that block out all light, and used these to fight crime.

He also possessed superhuman senses, most notably his vision and hearing. His senses were said to be so acute that he could hear sap running through trees and see events occurring miles away. Heimdall also briefly possessed the Odinpower, which granted him the power to channel cosmic energies.",,"Heimdall, guardian of the Rainbow Bridge to Asgard. Heimdall, the eternally vigilant. Heimdall the immovable. |||| |||| *** ORIGIN *** |||| Heimdall was born gifted with senses so acute that they border on the extrasensory. An Asgardian, he proved himself an extraordinary warrior. With frequent invasion and war brought to Asgard from Storm Giants and Frost Giants among other threats Odin would seek a guard for the Bifrost bridge. Due to his natural gifts of vision, sight, and hearing, Heimdall was appointed as guardian of Asgard's Bifrost Bridge by Odin, after fierce competition from fellow Asgardian warriors Agnar the Fierce and Gotron the Agile. Both of whom were also interested for the duty of guarding the Bifrost. Heimdall is the brother of Sif and frequent ally and friend to Thor. He is a highly respected and standing Asgardian, occasionally even serving as temporary ruler of Asgard. |||| |||| Not only has Heimdall served as sentry of the Bifrost bridge, but he has also been active as an agent for Odin. Heimdall played a large role in locating and gathering several mortals who would go on to be a part of the Young Gods, new super beings that would be used to pacify the Celestials judgement of Earth. Heimdall would specifically gather Chi Lo, Carter Dylam and Jason Kimball otherwise known as Harvest, Bright Sword and Genii respectively. After the powerful entity Surtur defeated Heimdall and destroyed the Bifrost, Heimdall would even briefly romance Enchantress, but would eventually return to his stand as the guardian of Bifrost upon its reconstruction. Heimdall would also take part in a rescue mission to save his sister Sif, as well as stand in for Odin as ruler of Asgard when the All Father required rest. |||| |||| *** |||| |||| Heimdall was the brother of the warrior Sif. For ages, he stood as the guardian of Asgard's rainbow bridge, defending the city's gates from any intruders, and was one of the most trusted servants of Odin. When Asgard was invaded by the fire demon Surtur, Heimdall attempted to defend the gates, but was overcome, and the Rainbow Bridge was destroyed. No longer needing to be stationary, Heimdall spent more time in Asgard, and became close to Amora the Enchantress, who was soon infatuated with him. When Odin returned to Asgard after Surtur's defeat, he gave a portion of his power to Heimdall to rebuild the Rainbow Bridge, and Heimdall resumed his duties. |||| |||| Shortly afterwards, when Odin was about to enter his Odinsleep, he passed the Odinpower on to Heimdall to rule Asgard until he awoke. Heimdall had to deal with a major crisis in the life of Thor, as Thor had been banished into the subconsciousness of the mortal Eric Masterson, who had assumed Thor's responsibilities. Sif was determined to find the real Thor, and her determination drove a wedge between her and Heimdall. When Karnilla conspired with Loki to rule Asgard by having Odin awaken with Loki's soul possessing him, Heimdall was branded a traitor and banished to the Dream Dimension, where he was saved from the demon Nightmare by Amora. Eric Masterson helped restore Odin and later Thor as well, but Heimdall and Amora drifted apart when Amora realized that his duty to Asgard was greater than his love for her. |||| When Odin cast the Asgardians into the guises of mortals to protect them from a false Ragnarok, Heimdall became Donald Velez, and joined the other 'Lost Gods' in attempting to rediscover who they were and battling the Egyptian death-god Seth. Heimdall and the others regained their true forms and defeated Seth just as Asgard was attacked by the Dark Gods, and they were all taken prisoner. They were finally rescued by Thor. Recently, Asgard was struck by another Ragnarok, one from which there was no seeming reversal. Heimdall perished in battle defending his people. |||| |||| It has been revealed that Thor has broken the cycle of Ragnarok, the end of all things that has seemingly come to Asgard many times. Heimdall, along with the others of Asgard, have been reborn on Earth yet again. A new version of the city has been established in Oklahoma. |||| |||| Thor traveled to New Orleans to start his journey of finding the missing gods. After a confrontation with Iron Man, he encounters a man named Ezra, keeping vigil over a bridge. Realizing who he really is, Thor releases Heimdall from within the mortal. Heimdall was drawn to Ezra due to them both feeling angry and helpless due to the fact that neither of them could stop the destruction of their cities, New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina and Asgard during Ragnarok. Heimdall has now joined Thor in the new Asgard."

67,Iceman (Marvel),Robert Louis 'Bobby' Drake ,67_20060308113659_char.jpg,"Iceman is able to lower his external and internal body temperature without harm to himself, thereby radiating intense cold from his body. Iceman is able to reach -105 degrees Fahrenheit within a few seconds, and is immune to sub-zero temperatures around him. |||| In addition, Iceman can freeze any moisture in the air around him into unusually hard ice, and thereby form simple objects such as slides, ladders, shields, and bats. Iceman can also augment his ice form with extraneous moisture to enhance his strength and durability, and can reshape his body's ice form at will by using any available moisture from his surrounding environment. Similarly, Iceman can rebuild his ice form if any part of it is broken or if it is shattered completely without suffering any permanent damage. |||| |||| Previously, Iceman was able to transform his body into solid ice and back to human form at will. Recently, however, his body has since permanently transformed into solid ice as a result of a secondary mutation. |||| |||| Iceman also possesses the potential to transport himself quickly over great distances through nearby flows of water by merging his body’s molecules with those of the stream.",,"Bobby Drake discovered his mutant power to create ice while in his early teens, yet kept his condition hidden from everyone but his parents. Initially, Bobby was unable to stop feeling cold and shivering, but soon managed to keep it under control. When a bully named Rocky Beasely and his friends attacked Bobby and his then-girlfriend, Judy Harmon, the youngster panicked. To save Harmon, Bobby temporarily encased Rocky in ice, thus revealing his abilities for all to see. Believing the boy to be a menace, the townspeople organized a lynch mob. They broke into Bobby's home and overpowered him, but the local sheriff took the teenager into custody for his own protection. Meanwhile, the situation had come to the attention of Professor Charles Xavier, the telepathic mentor of the team of teenage mutant super heroes the X-Men. |||| |||| Professor X dispatched his first X-Man, Cyclops, to contact Bobby. Cyclops stole into the jailhouse as planned, but the two began fighting when Bobby refused to accompany him. Caught by the lynch mob, Cyclops and Bobby were about to be hanged when they broke free. Professor X used his mental powers to halt the townspeople in their tracks and erase their memories of Bobby's powers. A grateful Bobby then accepted Xavier's invitation to enroll at his School for Gifted Youngsters and took the codename Iceman. Though initially manifesting as a snow-like form, Bobby soon learned to increase his degree of cold control resulting in an ice-like, almost transparent form. |||| |||| Hated and feared by humanity, the X-Men honed their amazing abilities while standing in defense of a world pushed to the brink of genetic war by a handful of mutant terrorists. Iceman, the team's youngest founding member, became known as the comedian of the group. Regardless, he pulled his weight and worked well with rest of the team. |||| |||| Following a short break-up after believing their mentor was dead, the X-Men reformed with two new members - the magnetism-manipulating Polaris and the plasma-charged Havok. Bobby had a brief romantic relationship with Polaris until she realized that her heart belonged to Havok. Bobby had trouble accepting her decision, which led to increased tension between himself and Havok. Eventually, Bobby quit the team for a short time to sort out his feelings. |||| |||| Later, when the sentient island-being known as Krakoa took Bobby and his team mates captive, Professor X assembled a second team of X-Men to rescue them. Soon after, most of the founding members left the team and Bobby began attending college on a scholarship. Eventually, he helped his former team mate Angel form the Champions of Los Angeles. When the Champions disbanded, Bobby went missing, and Angel teamed up with the costumed adventurer Spider-Man to find him. Bobby had been hypnotized by the Champions' enemy Rampage into donning his battle suit, and Angel and Spider-Man were forced to battle him. After Rampage was defeated, Bobby quit his life as a costumed adventurer and returned to college full time to study accounting. |||| |||| Later, Bobby was contacted by Professor X to assist in rescuing friends and family of the X-Men from the assassin known as Arcade. Along with other former X-Men Banshee, Polaris, and Havok, the ad-hoc team managed to free the hostages and Bobby finally came to accept Polaris' love for Havok. |||| |||| During a summer break from college Bobby went to visit his former X-Men teammate Beast and soon became involved with the loose-knit collection of costumed heroes known as the Defenders. Along with Beast and Angel, Bobby helped reorganize the team into a more formal and cohesive unit. The Defenders eventually disbanded when several of their members appeared to perish during a climactic battle. |||| |||| Soon after, Bobby joined the other founding X-Men to form X-Factor, an organization that intended to seek out and aid other mutants under the pretense of hunting down those perceived menaces to society. During his time with the team, the Asgardian trickster god Loki captured Bobby, hoping to use him to gain control over the Frost Giants. Loki enhanced Bobby's powers to such an extent that he was forced to wear a power-dampening belt that was originally created by the subversive organization known as The Right to cancel out his powers. Once able only to sheathe his own body in a protective coating of ice, Bobby found he could encase the entirety of the Empire State Building. With time, Bobby gained sufficient control over his augmented powers that he was able to stop using the inhibitor belt. Believing he had achieved his full potential, Bobby never attempted to push himself beyond his perceived limits. |||| |||| When Professor Xavier returned to Earth following an extended absence in outer space, Bobby and the other members of X-Factor rejoined the X-Men. Shortly thereafter, Bobby confronted former Cosmonaut Mikhail Rasputin, the reality-warping mutant brother of Bobby’s steel-skinned teammate Colossus. Rasputin forced Bobby into a form composed entirely of ice, affording the young mutant a glimpse into his true nature. Subsequently, Bobby began experimenting with his abilities - using ice to add mass to his slight frame, or lift himself high into the air without the benefit of his usual slides. |||| |||| Months later, the psychically incapacitated mutant telepath Emma Frost took mental possession of Bobby's body. Frost was able to activate the full extent of his powers, using his powers in ways Bobby had not thought possible until she was coaxed back into her own body by Professor X. With Frost's prodding, Iceman later learned to completely transform his body into its full ice state on his own. Frost later also showed Bobby that he could safely revert back to his human form after his ice form's chest had been shattered in battle. |||| |||| Bobby later took a leave of absence from the X-Men to spend more time with his father who had been injured by the grass roots anti-mutant movement the Friends of Humanity. He returned briefly to the X-Men to rescue mutant doctor Cecilia Reyes during the government-sponsored anti-mutant Operation: Zero Tolerance, after which he returned to his father's side. |||| |||| Two subsequent events served to shed further light on Iceman's untapped potential. To secure a new host body, the would-be conqueror Apocalypse sought to siphon the awesome energies of 'The Twelve' - mutants of incredible power, destined to alter the course of human history. Among their number was Iceman, who survived the ordeal thanks only to the apparent sacrifice of Cyclops. |||| |||| A second defining event occurred when the sentient spaceship Prosh escaped the confines of a Celestial prison, returned to Earth and dispatched a group of disparate beings on a journey through time to uncover the keys to preserving human evolution. Their mission: Save the human race from a threat that might not manifest itself for millions of years. When Prosh reassembled the members of his team in the present, they fought and defeated the enigmatic alien entity known as the Stranger, who sought to control the natural evolution of humans and mutants. |||| |||| These experiences forced Iceman into the realization that he no longer need fear the evolution of his abilities, and he returned to the X-Men to explore his mutant powers to the fullest. After suffering a chest injury, Bobby was unable to prevent his body from transforming into solid ice due to the manifestation of a secondary mutation. |||| |||| After the House of M incident Iceman was believed to be among the mutants who lost their powers, but this apparent loss of powers was quickly revealed to be a subconscious reaction to the trauma of that reality warp. Since recovering his powers, his ice form has taken on a much more jagged appearance. |||| Recently, Iceman has been using his powers in innovative ways, including the ability to exist as a sentient gas. He discovered this ability while fighting the Children of the Vault when they attacked the Mansion. After the fight with the Children, he joined Rogue's team of X-Men. |||| |||| [At an unspecified time, all five original adolescent X-Men had been plucked from their timeline and transferred to the future to interact with their adult selves.  During this event young Jean revealed to young Bobby that her telepathic abilities had discovered that he is gay (All New X-Men #40).]"

He has consistently been able to create force fields, teleport others,and generate lightning and force blasts with little or no effort.",,"Billy Kaplan is the eldest of three sons born to Reform Jews Jeff Kaplan (a cardiologist ) and Rebecca Kaplan (a psychologist) |||| |||| Regularly bullied in school, Billy found solace outside the gates of the Avengers Mansion. One day, Billy encountered the Avenger the Scarlet Witch, who told him to stand his ground the next time it happens. She then touched his head, causing a red light to flash briefly. The flash heals Billy's wounds and a few weeks later he stands up for another kid being bullied, and demonstrates his powers for the first time, but is not fully prepared for their effects. |||| |||| He was one of the Young Avengers chosen as a result of the Vision's plan for the reformation of the Avengers, in the event the team ever disbanded. He originally chose the code name Asgardian, but later changed it to Wiccan. |||| |||| The full extent of his powers are unknown, though they include flight and lightning generation. He can cast spells using a technique learned from 'self-help books' owned by fellow Young Avenger Hulkling's mother. By chanting a mantra/statement of intent (for example, 'I want Iron Lad to forget') and focusing on the outcome he wants to achieve, he can cause different events and effects to happen. |||| |||| Billy has said that Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, was his favorite Avenger, and it has been implied that his powers are linked to hers. Billy's possible relationship to Wanda was revealed by the Super-Skrull and Vision. |||| |||| In the past, Scarlet Witch was so desperate to have children that she used her reality warping powers to create twin sons out of fragments of the soul of the demon Mephisto. When the boys' souls were reabsorbed into Mephisto, because of the power Wanda put into the soul fragments, they destroyed him and their souls were reincarnated as Thomas Shepherd (the Young Avenger Speed), and Billy. |||| |||| During the Civil War, Billy and Tommy plan to look for Wanda. They hope that revelation that her sons appear to be alive and well will aid in her recovery. However, their plan is disrupted by the attack by the Zodiac on the United Nations and the subsequent events of the Civil War. |||| |||| S.H.I.E.L.D. arrests the Young Avengers. However, Sam Wilson (Falcon) and Steve Rogers (Captain America) intercept the S.H.I.E.L.D bus which is transporting the prisoners and Wiccan teleports the team out of the situation, into the Resistance Fighters base of operations. |||| |||| When the Runaways try to stay out of the conflict, they barely manage to escape from the government forces. Hearing of this development on the news, the Young Avengers decide to help the Runaways even though Captain America had vetoed the plan. Wiccan uses his magic to locate and teleport to the Runaways. However, the Runaways believe that the Young Avengers have come to capture them and a fight ensues until Eli (Patriot) succeeds in convincing Nico to stop the hostilities. The two teams are later attacked by Noh-Varr, who captures Wiccan and Hulkling, and (apparently) kills the Runaway Xavin. The young heroes become the prisoners of the Warden, who proceeds to practice vivisection on the unconscious Teddy. This has little physical effect on Hulkling, whose vital organs keep shifting out of the way of the Warden's knife, but it does have a strong psychological effect on Billy, who cries out, 'I want you to die.' (He is subsequently very grieved that he has been manipulated into so much hatred.) The boys are rescued by Xavin, whose Skrull physiology allowed him to recover from Noh-Varr's attack. He comes close to killing the Warden, but Teddy stops him. |||| |||| Wiccan is among the Secret Avengers who take part in the first major battle of the Civil War and was one of the first two incapacitated. Tony Stark and Peter Parker realize that the two rebels with teleportation powers needed to be sidelined to prevent an escape from the ambush. So, Wiccan and Cloak are shot with tranquilizer darts and rendered unconscious. This attack on two of his youngest followers infuriates Steve Rogers (Captain America). A violent battle ensues, by the end of which, Goliath lies dead, slain by the cyborg clone of Thor. Most of the Anti-Registration group escapes, but Wiccan is left behind and captured by the Pro-Registration side. |||| |||| Billy and the other imprisoned anti-Registration heroes are eventually freed in a raid led by Captain America. This liberation is made possible largely by Teddy's shape-shifting ability, which allows him to mimic Hank Pym's retinal and voice patterns, and thereby release all the prisoners from their cells. ||||"

During this time, he met lifelong friend Ben Grimm, future wife Sue Storm, and Victor von Doom, a fellow student and intellectual rival whose jealousy would lead him over time to become Reed's nemesis, Doctor Doom. |||| |||| When the government cut funding for Reed's research in manned space travel, he set out to pursue the project on his own.  Convinced they would be safe, he allowed Sue and her younger brother Johnny to accompany him and Ben on a test flight, during which they were exposed to high levels of cosmic radiation and forced to crash-land.  As it turned out, the radiation transformed each of the passengers, leading to their careers as the superhuman Fantastic Four, with Reed as their leader. |||| |||| The Fantastic Four has had many adventures over the years, propelled by Reed's scientific inventions, and motivated by their concern for the betterment of the world.  Funded by money from patents Reed has developed, the group operates out of the Baxter Building in Manhattan, although their journeys take them across the span of any number of universes, times, and dimensions. |||| |||| Having married, Reed and Sue have two children, Franklin and Valeria, the first of which, at least, has exhibited his own superpowers, capable of bending reality on a fundamental level.  In recent years, Reed has been involved with some of the most important events in the Marvel universe, helping to exile the Hulk in space, and working alongside Tony Stark to enforce the Super-human Registration Act.  While these actions have had some conflicts between Reed and even his closest friends and family, including a period of alienation from Sue, he has proven to be motivated always by a concern for the greater good, acting in accord with what rationality dictates is the best course, no matter how seemingly unpopular. ||||"

7515,Orka (Marvel),,7515_20070402124011_char.jpg,"Orka's original physiology was that of a Atlantean who happened to be a twenty four foot giant. As typical Atlanteans can lift roughly 10 to 30 tons depending on their athletic prowess, a giant of hulkish muscular proportions such as Orka could lift several times that amount; roughly 90 tons. Later his physiology was augmented so that it was at least equal to that of Namor the Submariner who can lift 100 tons or more when in contact with water. |||| |||| He once utilized a costume which augmented his strength greatly by psionically harnessing power from killer whales through artificial means. It also allowed him to exist on land although when not in contact with water he was roughly thirty three percent weaker. At present he no longer needs his costume to utilize such powers due to scientific experimentation conducted upon his physiology. His improved phsyiology had the side effect of reducing his intelligence, though not the degree of a mental handicap. |||| |||| Orka can communicate with and summon killer whales (whose company he prefers to Atlanteans). When he is in their presence he is considerably stronger than normal. He can also swim at superhuman speeds. He can survive on land much longer than typical Atlanteans, though it is has not been revealed if prolonged exposure of several days or more will kill him. Orka's endurance is heightened to the degree that conventional weaponry has no effect on him. |||| |||| Orka has the typical training of an Atlantean warrior and is a highly skilled fighter. This is often not very obvious as his intellect is a weakness often exploited by lesser adversaries.",,"Orka was once an Atlantean and grew to become one of the strongest (but relatively dim-witted) soldiers in Warlord Krang's army. Orka stayed with Krang when he attempted to gain the throne from Namor the Sub-Mariner, and was exiled with his leader. Soon, Orka was chosen to be the test subject of Dr. Dorcas, who wanted to imbue a soldier with the power of a killer whale (At this point, Orka needed to wear a belt which transferred the power of Dorcas' captive killer whales). Namor defeated the rebels, and Orka was buried in an undersea avalanche. |||| |||| Later, Orka managed to get free but was defeated by Namor again. The Brand Corporation (subsidiary of Roxxon Oil) contacted Orka and augmented his abilities to not require a power-transferring machine. He was then sent on a mission that brought him in conflict with the Avengers, but was defeated by Thor. |||| |||| Somehow, he managed to escape from prison (he was seen in the Vault during the break-out called 'Acts of Vengeance') and found his way to the Atlantic, where he was among Attuma's henchmen in his Deep Six group (alongside Nagala, Pirahna, Sea Urchin, and Tiger Shark) when Attuma attacked the United States where they were defeated by Namor and clashed with the Defenders on different occasions. |||| |||| Later, Orka was among those villains recruited by the self-proclaimed Master of the World in his attempt to overthrow the United Nations, only to be captured by the new Heroes for Hire team. He also fought Namorita once, but was later defeated by a blast coming from Nova. |||| |||| Orka recently tried to engage Nightwing Restorations, Colleen Wing and Misty Knight's bail bond company for supervillains, to bail out Stilt-Man. Recently Orka joined the Heroes For Hire, along with a few other reformed supervillains. Currently he works with the team to hunt supervillains."

Later, when Deathbird was Empress, she commanded the entire Imperial Guard to fight the combined forces of the Starjammers and Excalibur so that she could claim the power of the Phoenix Force for herself. During the battle, Astra surprised Shadowcat with the ability to hit her in intangible state, since she could match her molecular density. |||| |||| During the crisis that came to be known as Operation: Galactic Storm, Astra was amongst a small contingent of the Imperial Guard that defended Lilandra against the Kree super-team known as Starforce. Astra was also with the Imperial Guard when they defended their Empress Lilandra against an assassination attempt from the Inhumans, who were under the control of Ronan the Accuser at the time. ||||"
3182,Count Nefaria (Marvel),Luchino Nefaria ,3182_20070125122114_char.jpg,"When his body is fully charged with ionic energy, Nefaria possesses tremendous, nearly immeasurable strength and durability, high-level superhuman speed, the power of flight, and the ability to fire powerful laser beams from his eyes. In recent times, he has also proven capable of forming and manipulating crude ionic energy constructs, such as an energy strand used to lasso an opponent. If Nefaria's bodily ionic energy reserves dwindle too low, his powers start to fade and his body begins to wither and age rapidly. Nefaria periodically replenishes his energies by draining power from outside sources of ionic energy, often draining other ionic-powered super-beings like himself. If Nefaria drains too much energy too quickly, his victim will die. Like other ionic super-beings such as Atlas and Wonder Man, Nefaria has apparently developed astounding regenerative powers, enabling him to heal himself from a seemingly deceased state or even reintegrate his bodily matter after exploding.",,"Born a wealthy Italian nobleman, Count Luchino Nefaria grew up regarding himself as one of the rightful masters of the world, and has dedicated his life to making this grandiose self-image a reality. While Nefaria has long devoted himself to the funding and development of exotic new sciences and technologies, he also treasures old-world values, often presenting himself in the manner of a courtly feudal nobleman of ages past. Apparently not content with the power afforded him by wealth and nobility, Nefaria risked his prized respectability and entered the world of organized crime, secretly becoming a leading figure in the international criminal cartel known as the Maggia. With his vast wealth, high-tech resources and natural gift for criminal strategy, Nefaria soon became the leader of his own thriving crime family within the Maggia organization, all the while concealing his criminal connections from the general public. |||| |||| Luchino wanted a male heir to perpetuate the Nefaria line, but his wife Renata died giving birth to their only child, their daughter Giulietta. Wishing to protect the child from his enemies and hoping to shield her from ever learning of his criminal empire, Nefaria placed her in the custody of Byron Frost, an American financier heavily indebted to Nefaria, and he had Frost raise her as his own adopted daughter, Whitney. While Whitney grew up in America, blissfully unaware of her true parentage, Count Nefaria's Maggia family began expanding their operations into the United States, but they were repeatedly opposed by America's crimefighters, particularly the Avengers. Deciding to handle this obstacle personally, Nefaria had his ancestral castle moved from Italy to New Jersey stone by stone. Opening the castle to public tours and donating the admission money to charity, the seemingly benevolent Nefaria invited the unwitting Avengers to his home, where he trapped them in stasis long enough to frame them for treason by using sophisticated illusions. Reduced to hunted fugitives, the Avengers stormed Nefaria's castle and defeated his mob soldiers, though Wasp was gravely wounded in the process. In the end, the heroes rescued their young Teen Brigade allies from one of Nefaria's death traps, the Avengers were exonerated, and Nefaria was exposed to the world as a criminal. |||| |||| The Avengers' defeat of Nefaria hurt the influence and stature of Nefaria's Maggia crime family considerably. While he worked to rebuild his empire, Nefaria contacted the now-adult Whitney Frost, revealed he was her father, and invited her to join his Maggia crime family so that he could train her as his future successor. Horrified, Whitney refused the offer at first, but Nefaria threatened to expose her parentage to the world, and her own fiancé abandoned her after he learned the truth about her family. Losing all hope of a normal life, a broken Whitney joined her father's organization, soon becoming his second-in-command. Nefaria, still plotting to destroy the Avengers, targeted Iron Man (secretly Avengers financier Tony Stark) with an illusion-casting 'nightmare machine' in an attempt to frighten him literally to death, but Iron Man resisted the device, which a frustrated Nefaria accidentally wrecked. Nefaria next conspired with Tony Stark's ne'er-do-well cousin, Morgan Stark, to ruin Tony's reputation, but this scheme failed as well. Nefaria later shocked the nation by sealing the entire city of Washington under an artificial dome and holding it for ransom, but he and his super-criminal accomplices were defeated by the original X-Men and the city was freed. Nefaria was imprisoned and his daughter took over their Maggia crime family, but the Count soon escaped. |||| |||| Frozen out of the Maggia due to his very public failures, Nefaria became an independent criminal operator. Employing the Ani-Men (whom he had his scientists mutate into superhumans), Nefaria seized the North American Air Defense Command at Valhalla Mountain in Colorado and threatened to launch America's nuclear arsenal unless he was paid an enormous ransom. His scheme was thwarted by a new team of X-Men, including Thunderbird (James Proudstar), who died trying to prevent Nefaria's escape. His monetary and technological resources dwindling, Nefaria sought superhuman power for himself. Assembling Living Laser, Power Man (Erik Josten) and Whirlwind to battle the Avengers as a new Lethal Legion, Nefaria had their powers boosted by scientist Kenneth Sturdy, but it was a deliberately temporary boost. While the Legion was captured, Sturdy used his process (derived from the ionic energy treatments of Baron Zemo) to give Nefaria the Legion's combined powers, magnified a hundredfold. Despite Nefaria's newly god-like power, the Avengers managed to defeat him after a desperate battle, and the villain learned that he was aging rapidly as a result of the process that gave him his powers. |||| |||| Deteriorating into an aged invalid who needed a special life-support system, Nefaria escaped custody with the aid of the Ani-Men and his daughter, who by this time had become romantically involved with Tony Stark. When Iron Man (whom Whitney knew to be Stark) tried to take Nefaria back into custody, the Ani-Men and Whitney resisted, and Nefaria was accidentally crushed during the battle. Betrayed by her lover and convinced her father was dead, an increasingly bitter and paranoid Whitney went deep into hiding in her role as crime boss Madame Masque, operating mostly through surrogates for years, even producing clones of herself to act in her stead (one of these 'bio-duplicates,' a rogue known simply as Masque, broke away from Whitney's service and briefly served as an honorary Avenger before she was recaptured). |||| |||| Nefaria eventually revived, apparently sharing the regenerative properties common among ionic super-beings; however, he found that he needed to drain ionic energy from others in order to maintain his vitality. Becoming a sort of ionic vampire, Nefaria stalked and drained various ionic-powered beings, killing some of them (notably the Nefaria imitator known as Nefarius) and capturing others (the Deathweb's ionic Therak was imprisoned as an energy source for some time). Trying to cover his tracks, Nefaria was eventually found out and exposed by his old foe Iron Man. Later, Nefaria imprisoned and cloned the inhabitants of the Savage Land for experimental purposes, trying to create a race of ionic beings he could feed off so that he wouldn't have to keep hunting down existing ionics. He was defeated and captured by Captain America and Sharon Carter and left in the custody of the Savage Landers, though he soon escaped. Attacking ionic-powered heroes Atlas and Wonder Man, Nefaria absorbed some of their energy and realized that this process enabled him to subjugate their wills, too. |||| |||| Aided by his new slaves, Nefaria sought to consolidate the Maggia crime families under his leadership (with the Grim Reaper acting as his lieutenant) and tried to force Whitney to return to his service, all as part of a larger scheme to mutate the entire world with ionic radiation so that everyone would be compelled to obey Nefaria. His plot was thwarted through the combined efforts of Whitney, the Avengers and the Thunderbolts, though not before Nefaria murdered the heroic bio-duplicate Masque, whom he believed to be his rebellious daughter. In the end, Nefaria was apparently blown to atoms, but he somehow survived and was jailed in the super-prison known as The Raft, where he was recently among the many inmates who escaped during a prison break sparked by Electro."

He was due to be executed by King Philip of Spain, when the King learned Valor had just married the king's own ward, Donna Bonita.  The King then struck a bargain with Valor, promising to spare his life if he would serve the Spanish flag.  Valor agreed under the condition that the flag would always represent the cause of justice.  Eventually, though, Spain disappointed, and Valor fled back to England.   He and Donna had a son, Justin, who took to the seas with him.  Justin, though, eventually was injured, forcing Valor to rethink his life.   He thus unmasked himself before King Charles and swore to disavow the pirate's life forever.  His son, though, had made no such vow, and became embroiled in the cause of the Puritans.  Needing cash for their impending journey to America, Justin pirated Charles' vessels for the Puritans.  Charles called Valor out of retirement to discover who was behind this new wave of pirating.  When Jon investigated he was shocked to discover it was his own son.  They made a peace, however, that allowed Justin to set sail for America with the Puritans, and satisfy Charles' requirement that Jon end the wave of pirating.

251,Black Mask (DC)(01 - Roman Sionis),Roman Sionis ,251_20070330213102_char.jpg,,,"Roman Sionis was born into one of Gotham City�s elite families, to parents who were wealthy and utterly self-absorbed, caring more about their social status than their son; moments after his birth, the doctor carelessly dropped him on his head. Roman's parents were less concerned about their son's well-being and more concerned about covering up the entire incident out of fear of how their wealthy friends would react to the news of their son's injury. A second incident occurred when he was a child. While at the Sinois family country estate he was attacked by a rabid raccoon. This incident was also covered up by the Sionis family, with Roman being forbidden from mentioning it to anyone. |||| |||| Further adding to the cauldron was his father's 'friendship' with Thomas Wayne; both of Roman's parents disliked the Waynes and were quite vocal about it in private with their son. However, to their son's dismay, they continued to associate with Thomas and Martha Wayne and pretended to be friends with the couple, to the extent of literally forcing him to become friends with their son, Bruce. His parents' hypocrisy had a deep impact on him, and he grew to hate and resent them and the 'masks' they wore in public. |||| |||| When he graduated high school, Sionis was given a high ranking position inside his fathers company, Janus Cosmetics. It was there that he met and fell in love with Circe, a young working class secretary. His parents didn't approve of the relationship and made it clear that they wanted the romance ended. Enraged, Roman burned down the family's mansion, killing both of his parents. Upon their deaths he inherited the family fortune and business. As Roman wasn't the businessman his father was he ended up ruining Janus Cosmetics by funding a line of face-paint make-up which failed. In desperation he threw large sums of money at the staff chemists to create a product to save the company, and what came back to him was a kind of water-proof make up. The product was rushed to market without proper testing, and once it hit the market turned out to be a deadly toxin which disfigured several hundred women. |||| |||| Circe, now Sionis' fiancé, broke up with him in front of his entire staff. At that time, now successful mogul Bruce Wayne offered to bail out the company on the condition that Sionis give up control and allow Wayne to appoint his own Board of Directors. Sionis agreed, but was furious at the perceived humiliation and dramatic loss of face he had suffered. He went to the family mausoleum and broke his mother's ebony coffin lid and carved a mask from a large chunk of it, becoming Black Mask as he had always been obsessed with masks, and the idea that a person becomes someone else when they wear one. |||| |||| Sionis found he had an amazing aptitude for crime, and he soon had a large gang working for him. Calling them the False Face Society, the one requirement was that all members must select a mask from his collection and wear it at all times when on the job and in his presence. They were successfully gaining power in the Gotham underworld, until Black Mask decided it was time to take his revenge on Bruce Wayne. He began kidnapping Wayne Enterprise executives, putting masks on their faces that were coated in the deadly make-up once made by Janus Cosmetics. He also targeted Circe and forcibly disfigured her with the chemicals in order to force her to reunite with him. Circe would ultimately kill herself, leading Black Mask to replace her with a mannequin that he talked to as if it were a real person. |||| |||| These kidnappings drew Batman's attention, and he began hunting down the False Facers. He slowly began to dismantle the organization until he finally found Black Mask in the ruins of the Sionis Family home. Black Mask lit the wreckage on fire trying to escape, but was caught in the burning house. Batman was able to save him, but the mask had been burned onto his face and left him disfigured. |||| |||| Black Mask spent some time in Arkham Asylum, but escaped when Bane assaulted the facility in Knightfall and subsequently restarted the False Facers. He took on a new second-in-command, called Tattoo (whose face was covered in a tattoo mask pattern), and he began burning down Wayne properties. This time he also kidnapped Lucius Fox, CEO of Waynetech and friend of Bruce Wayne. Batman infiltrated the gang and was able to save Fox from Black Mask's torture, and even brought in Tattoo, but Black Mask escaped. |||| |||| Some time later, Black Mask reappeared as a mob-boss/cult figure who had given up his vendetta against Bruce Wayne. Making allegiance with the Penguin at some times, working alone at others, he controlled much of Gotham's underworld until the city was destroyed by an earthquake and declared by the government to be a 'No Man's Land.' |||| |||| Sionis discarded the ebony mask, believing his scars to be a sign of his strength and determination to survive. By now completely insane, he led a cult whose trademark was ritual scarring, killing anyone who refused to join. He led a powerful group until Batman and Huntress dissolved it. Sionis was imprisoned in Blackgate Penitentiary, but he managed to escape before the city was made a part of the country again. |||| |||| Black Mask had lost much of his power base, and it took him some time to rebuild his empire. He began a drug trafficking ring and decided to move his organization into Gotham's East End, drawing the attention of Catwoman, who had sworn to protect that area of the city. |||| |||| Catwoman interfered in Black Mask's plans, stealing money from him and giving it to the poor, and injuring many of his men. Black Mask decided he wanted to remove the problem, and so found an old friend of Selina Kyle's, Sylvia Sinclair, who was working in the Gotham mobs. She revealed Catwoman's secret identity to him, and he began a campaign of terror against her. He blew up the new youth center she had endowed with the stolen money, hounded her, and kidnapped her sister and brother-in-law. Black Mask tortured Catwoman's brother-in-law brutally in front of her sister, and then made the woman eat pieces of her husband's corpse. |||| |||| Catwoman arrived to find her brother-in-law dead, her sister insane, and her friend Holly on the verge of being tortured. She attacked Black Mask, and the two of them fought across his penthouse. At the end of the battle, Black Mask fell from the top of the building, leaving everyone to assume he was dead. |||| |||| When Tim Drake quit his role as Robin in order to honor a promise to his father, Batman chose Stephanie Brown, aka Spoiler, to replace him. Batman quickly discovered that her lack of focus and self-absorption made her a danger to herself and others, and fired her. Desperate to prove herself, she took one of Batman's contingency plans and set it into action with the intent of shepherding it to a successful conclusion. The plan was to get all of Gotham's crime lords under the control of Orpheus, an agent of Batman, and therefore under the control of Batman himself. The plan failed because Spoiler was unaware that a key contact with the crime lords, Matches Malone, was actually another alter ego of Batman himself. When 'Matches Malone' did not appear as expected, the tension at the meeting accidentally degenerated into a firefight, leaving many dead and wounded. This created a power vacuum that quickly erupted into a brutal gang war on the streets of Gotham. |||| |||| Desperate to rectify the situation, Spoiler sought Orpheus, believing that if she could enlist his help there might still be a chance to bring the plan to some sort of successful conclusion. As she finished telling Orpheus his role in the plan, Black Mask murdered him by slitting his throat in front of Spoiler. He then tortured Spoiler for the rest of information on the plan. |||| |||| Black Mask assumed Orpheus' identity, using face putty and padding, (as seen in 'Batman: War Games, Act 2') managing to fool even Batman and Onyx. As Orpheus he fanned the flames of the crisis, driving Gotham's criminal element into a bloodthirsty, destructive mob seeking to kill any member or associate of the Batman Family. He then returned to torture Spoiler for his own enjoyment only to find that she had escaped. Black Mask soon tracked her down again and they fought. Spoiler managed to overcome Black Mask and get away, but was left with severe internal injuries. |||| |||| Black Mask then infiltrated Oracle's Clocktower in an attempt to expose her to the criminal mob. Batman attacked him in a blind rage and Oracle, fearful for Batman's life, was forced to activate a self-destruct device in the tower to get Batman to save her. |||| |||| In the end, the Spoiler died due to the injuries inflicted on her and the willful negligence of Leslie Thompkins. (Although a recent retcon states that Black Mask 'tortured and killed' Stephanie Brown in current continuity.) |||| |||| Black Mask then rose to become the overlord of the Gotham underworld. |||| |||| Allied with reporter Arturo Rodriguez, Black Mask began a campaign to discredit Batman. While Rodriguez slammed Batman in the press, Black Mask committed a series of murders disguised as Batman. This plan was complicated by the arrival of the Joker. Black Mask was intent on killing the Clown Prince of Crime and framing Batman for it, but the Joker wanted to kill Black Mask, because he robbed him of the opportunity to kill another Robin. The two nearly killed each other before Batman intervened. Batman eventually exposed Rodriguez and finally managed to capture Black Mask. However, while being taken to jail, he managed to kill the escorting officer and escape again. |||| |||| The assassin Deathstroke later approached Black Mask offering him a place within The Society. Eager to strengthen his increasingly tenuous grip on the underworld (Batman and the new Red Hood had both been targeting his operations), he accepted, and Captain Nazi, one of the Hyenas, and Count Vertigo were sent after Batman and Red Hood. However, these villains were defeated, and Batman ultimately prevented the Society from securing a foothold in Gotham. |||| |||| In an attempt to 'improve himself' after this debacle, Black Mask threatened the most important people in Catwoman's life, from Slam Bradley to Holly Robinson. Still thinking that she adhered to a strict no-kill rule, Black Mask was caught by surprise when Catwoman retaliated by shooting him in the head and blowing off his jaw, killing him. |||| |||| After the shooting, Selina Kyle passed the mantle of Catwoman to her friend Holly. Not long after, Holly was arrested for the killing of Black Mask."

She assisted with the redesign, which resulted in the purple-and-black design he would sport for most of the rest of the Golden Age. Long after their crime-fighting days were over, the couple decided to take a final trip around the world in the pages of Starman vol. 2 #30.  As they arrived in the Orient, she died of apparently natural causes."

3091,Firestar (Marvel),Angelica Jones ,3091_20060720103855_char.jpg,"Firestar possesses the mutant ability to control and manipulate microwave energies. She is able to absorb and discharge these energies, and is actually, always and continually absorbing microwave energies from all around her environment, this includes such energy supplies as far away as the stars and the sun. By focusing and controlling these microwave energies, she’s able to discharge them for uses such as flight or as energy projection from her hands. The current temperature she’s able to achieve with her energy discharge is currently unknown. It has been shown that she is capable of melting almost every metal known to man, with the exception of adamantium. |||| |||| She can also use her powers to scramble electronics systems and to block certain forms of telepathy. Her microwave emissions are also highly effective against the other-dimensional energy known as the Darkforce (to the point she was able to free almost an entire city that had been taken over and was being controlled by the substance). |||| |||| In space, her powers are considerably more formidable as she has freer access to the microwave energies that surround her (the worries of harm to the surrounding areas is also not a concern in the vacuum of space).",(Former) There was a point when Firestar's mutant physiology hadn't developed a full immunity to the side-effects that her microwave manipulation powers were having on her. This problem was solved by Hank Pym of The Avengers when he created a suit that Firestar could wear under her costume that in a few months time would help fully develop her immunity to the side-effects of her own powers.,"Angelica Jones (nicknamed Angel) grew up with her father, Bartholomew ‘Bart’ Jones and her grandmother ‘Nana’ Jones. Due to her father’s job as a construction engineer, Angel and her family were constantly on the move, never giving her a chance to form any type of lasting friendships with her peers. For emotional support, she always turned to her grandmother, who, after pointing out that the lines on her hand formed an M, assured her that she was an incredibly special girl. Around the age of 13, Angel, unaware of her slowly manifesting mutant powers, began to give off microwave pulses when she was under stress. These microwave emissions were detected by both Professor Charles Xavier of The X-Men and Emma Frost (The White Queen) of The Hellfire Club, both of whom wanted to recruit Firestar to their respective schools, but both for very different reasons. |||| |||| During a particularly stressful moment, Angel called her grandmother, but melted the pay phone from which she was making the call. Returning home that evening, she was devastated to find that Nana had passed away that afternoon from natural causes. Feeling she had nowhere else to turn, she revealed her secret to her father, who, overwhelmed, didn’t handle the situation in the best manner. Now feeling completely alone, Angel was easy prey for Frost, who was able to get to Angel before Professor X and his X-Men were. Frost, using her telepathic abilities told Angel everything she wanted to hear, and with her father’s permission, Angel was enrolled in Frost’s Massachusetts Academy. |||| |||| Over the next few years, Angel, with the help of Frost, developed her powers and was given the codename Firestar. Frost, kind on the outside, was secretly training Angel to become an assassin for The Hellfire Club. Angel was kept at a distance from Frost’s other students, The Hellions, at Frost’s request, and Angel’s only real friend during her time at the Academy was her bodyguard, Randall Chase. Angel joined the Hellions Empath, Roulette and Thunderbird for a short period when she was manipulated by them into attacking The X-Men, where she battled Colossus. During their battle, Colossus noted that he could have killed the inexperienced Firestar with a single blow, but was unable to bring himself to do so. After the battle, Angel turned down an offer from Professor X to join his X-Men, still believing Frost to be like a mother to her. |||| |||| At the age of 16, Frost decided it was time to put her plans into motion, and began to manipulate Angel, trying to get her to kill her Hellfire Club rival Selene, The Black Queen. Knowing Frost would be sending Angel on a suicide mission, Chase decided he had to help her, and after being brutally beaten by Frost’s minions, Chase told Angel the full truth as he died in her arms. Furious, Angel destroyed Frost’s training facilities, and threatened Frost’s life if she were to ever come near or her family again. |||| |||| Angel decided to retire her Firestar persona, but that decision was soon detoured by Night Thrasher, who wanted Firestar to join the new group he was putting together. Summoning Firestar by using blackmail, he brought together himself, Firestar, Nova and Marvel Boy (Vance Astrovik later known as Justice) to form his team. They were soon put to the test against a returning Terrax, and were joined in battle by Namorita and Speedball. Defeating Terrax, the six teens decided to stay together and form the group, dubbed by the media, The New Warriors. During her time with the New Warriors, Firestar came into much greater control of her powers, and became an incredibly powerful force. Night Thrasher even commented at one point that Firestar could blow apart the planet if she so wished. As a group, The New Warriors faced down many foes, including the Juggernaut, Star-Thief, Psionex, The Sphinx, Force of Nature, The White Queen and her Hellions (who came to lay claim to Firestar) and Gamesmaster. It was also during this time, that Angel and Vance struck up a lasting and loving relationship, even getting engaged. |||| |||| Her father, having grown to accept Angel’s powers and become a loving father to her, was at one point, shot point blank in the chest by a street-gang group known as The Poison Memories, who had a vendetta against Night Thrasher and struck out at the New Warriors. Upon finding her father with her best friend Jupiter, Angel had no choice but to reveal her powers to Jupiter to save her father. Her father recovered, and Angel and Jupiter’s friendship grew even stronger. |||| |||| It was soon after that Angel learned that continued use of her powers could have devastating side-effects on her body, including making her sterile. Wanting to have a family one day, Angel started to seriously reconsider her priorities. During a break from The New Warriors, Firestar and Justice joined Rage in helping during an Avengers mission, and after was recruited into the Avengers alongside Justice. During her stint there, Hank Pym was able to develop a suit Angel could wear under her uniform that would cure her of the side-effects her powers were having on her and naturally speed up the immunity to her powers she should have developed on her own. Overjoyed, Angel recommitted to her life as a super-hero and became a core member of The Avengers. |||| |||| Deciding to take a break and focus on their relationship, Angel and Vance took some time to focus on their relationship. This was interrupted when Iron Man requested that the two infiltrate the Triune Understanding, a group that had been causing The Avengers much problems over the past few months. They did so, and the true nature of the Triune was soon discovered. The pair also helped The Avengers battle Kang during his take over of the world. They returned to reserve status right afterwards. |||| |||| At the age of 19, Angel started to feel overwhelmed with a life that consisted of being engaged, being a super-hero, and being a college student. Vance was able to sense a distance from Angel, and upon confronting her about it, she admitted that she felt like she was too young to get married. The two called off the long-standing engagement and went their separate ways. |||| |||| Most recently, the Superhuman Registration Act forced all openly active super-hero’s to register their identities with the federal government. During an interview with Sally Floyd for the newspaper Front Line, Angel recounted how the last time her identity was known, her father was almost killed. Deciding the risks were not worth it, Angel retired from being an active super-hero. With the recent events of the Skrull’s Secret Invasion, and the SHRA and the Initiative program taking the brunt of the fall-out for having failed to protect the world the way it was supposed to, it remains to be seen if Angel’s retirement will continue or if she’ll come back to the life of a super-hero."
350,Hourman (02 - Rick Tyler),Rick Tyler ,350_20070218083332_char.jpg,,,"Rick Tyler, Rex's son, took over the Hourman mantle during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Rick swallowed some of his father's Miraclo pills to help him save people trapped in a burning hospital. After serving for a few years as a member of Infinity, Inc., a team largely comprised of other JSA-member children, Rick began to grow addicted to Miraclo just as his father did. He spent many years after leaving the group critically ill until the android Hourman cured him of his Miraclo addiction. Having conquered his personal demons and regaining his health, Rick joined the re-formed JSA. He discovered that he had two added abilities: being able to see one hour into the future and to visit with his father in an otherworldly dimension called the Timepoint, frozen in time, just before Rex's death. Recently, Rick was severely injured in battle, and switched places with his father to save his life. Tyler, the android known as the third Hourman, took Rex and some other JSA members to the Timepoint to save Rick's life. The one hour Rex was allotted in the Timepoint expired just as Doctor Mid-Nite and Tyler had healed Rick of his injuries. Father and son fought over who would perish in the battle with Extant. Ultimately, Tyler the android took Rex's place and was destroyed as Rick and Rex returned to earth. Rick is once again active as Hourman."

His speed is superhuman (enabling him to outrun an express train with ease), and his stamina, reflexes and recuperative powers are also enhanced beyond normal human levels.",,"Twelve-year-old Elvin Haliday was visiting an unfamiliar neighborhood to trade some comic books with another boy when he was attacked by a gang of racist bullies. Elvin eluded them by hiding in the heavily polluted waters of Newtown Creek, but before he could climb out, Fisk Biochem workers dumped more illegal chemical waste into the creek, dousing him with it. Terrified and in pain, Elvin ran home to his only family, Granny Staples, and she nursed him back to health over a period of days. The boy recovered quickly, and in the weeks and months that followed, he went through a tremendous growth spurt that gave him a superhumanly powerful adult body. He was discouraged from seeking vengeance on his tormentors by the devoutly religious Granny Staples, who felt he should use his new powers for good. Fashioning a makeshift costume from a ski mask and a leather outfit, Elvin began operating as the super-vigilante Rage at the age of 14, targeting street criminals and drug dealers such as L.D. 50. He applied for membership in the Avengers, berating the team for their elitism and lack of visible minorities. Despite this obnoxious introduction, he was appointed a probationary Avengers reservist alongside Sandman after aiding the group in an otherdimensional mission. Though technically part of a substitute roster serving as backup for the active team, Rage was a frequent participant in Avengers cases, facing foes such as Ngh the Unspeakable, the Tetrarchs of Entropy, Doctor Doom, the Brethren, the Collector and Grotesk. |||| |||| |||| Eventually, during a conflict with Hate-Monger and his racist pawns, the Sons of the Serpent, the Avengers discovered that Elvin was still a child and demoted him to trainee status. During that case, Elvin met the New Warriors, who befriended him and later convinced him to help them steal an Avengers quinjet for an emergency rescue mission. Expelled from the Avengers for this misconduct, Rage joined the New Warriors, becoming a mainstay of the group and forming a close friendship with Speedball. When the Poison Memories gang killed Granny Staples as part of a vendetta against the Warriors, Rage cold-bloodedly killed gang leader Kimeiko Ashu, though a judge later deemed his actions self-defense. |||| |||| |||| Warriors leader Dwayne Taylor (Night-Thrasher) and Dwayne's mentor Andrew Chord were appointed Elvin's legal guardians, and when Dwayne later had a falling-out with the other Warriors, Elvin left the team with him. Serving as mentors to the troubled super-youths Psionex for a time, Night-Thrasher and Rage eventually rejoined the Warriors, who began to drift apart as their members pursued differing goals. Rage has decided to concentrate on his studies at the Oatridge School for Boys and is only infrequently active as a super hero of late, though he has been willing to assist the Avengers and the Warriors against foes such as the Elements of Doom, Morgan Le Fay, Whirlwind, Taskmaster, A.I.M., Lord Templar and an insane Scarlet Witch."

4209,Grandmaster (Marvel),En Dwi Gast ,4209_20070125131821_char.jpg,"The Grandmaster posses a cosmic life force which grants him a variety of superhuman traits, including a virtually immortal body, immunity to aging and disease, and imperviousness to conventional injury through regeneration of any injury. Also, the Grandmaster can utilize his cosmic life force for a variety of effects, including levitation, the projection of energy blasts, and travel through time and space and into alternate dimensions. He is also capable of transforming and rearranging matter on a planetary scale, he can cause death to others just by wishing it, and he can resurrect beings who are dead for less then 29.5 hours. Currently due to his machinations against Death, he cannot die. He is also capable of mentally computing diverse low information probabilities to the tenth decimal place with ease, and to retain vast amounts of data. He also possesses certain abilities of mental perception beyond those currently known, which enable him to receive information about his environment through extrasensory means. He also maintains a psychic link with the highly advanced computers of his base world, which extend and enhance his mental abilities.",,"Like those of all the Elders of the Universe, the Grandmaster’s origin is lost in early history of the universe. It is known that he is one of the oldest living beings in the universe. Like other Elders, he is the survivor of one of the intelligent races that evolved in one of the first galaxies to form after the “Big Bang”, the cataclysmic event in which the universe was created. Although his race became extinct and even his native galaxy died as the ages passed, the Grandmaster, like the other Elders, lived on, having become virtually immortal. As the relatively few survivors of the earliest period of the universe, the Elders regarded themselves as figuratively being brothers. |||| |||| The Grandmaster has spent his extraordinary long life in pursuit of amusement through the playing of games. He has traveled throughout the known universe studying many civilizations’ forms of games and play to the point of mastering them. He then began to devise his own types of tournaments and contests, challenging various opponents to games of skill and chance for high stakes. |||| |||| Capable of traversing space, time and the dimensions, the Grandmaster once journeyed to the alternate Earth inhabited by the Squadron Supreme to stage a contest with the time-traveling Scarlet Centurion. The Grandmaster’s standard method of playing games was to choose a team of champions to do combat with another team selected by his opponent. The Grandmaster used the Squadron Supreme as pawns for his games, while the Scarlet Centurion assembled various of the Squadron’s enemies as the Institute of Evil. Winning the contest, the Grandmaster determined to create is own Squadron since the original Squadron was unwilling to participate in further games. |||| |||| Returning to his own universe he traveled to Earth and transformed three men (Doctor Spectrum, Nighthawk, and the Whizzer) into counterparts of the Squadron members. He also created a counterpart to the Squadron’s Hyperion out of non-living extra dimensional matter and invested it with consciousness and artificial memories. These four counterparts became the criminal team known as the Squadron Sinister. |||| |||| The Grandmaster then journeyed to the time period of Kang the Conqueror (a temporal counterpart to the Scarlet Centurion) to engage in a contest against him. After Kang’s champions, the Avengers, defeated the Squadron Sinister, the Grandmaster drafted the World War II heroes, the Invaders. If Kang won, the Grandmaster would briefly grant him the power of either life or death. If Kang lost, the Grandmaster would destroy the Earth. Fortunately, Kang’s champions triumphed. |||| |||| Later, having returned to the 20th Century, the Grandmaster used Daredevil and the Defenders as his pawns against Doctor Doom‘s artificial creation the Prime Mover. Winning this match he decided to take control of the Earth as a breeding ground for superhuman-powered pawns for his games, but gave up the Earth after losing a bet with Daredevil. |||| |||| Although the Grandmaster can resurrect most living beings after their deaths, he cannot do so with virtually immortal beings like himself who are killed. Therefore the Grandmaster was unable to resurrect his “brother” the Collector, after he had been murdered. The Grandmaster challenged Death itself to a game. If Grandmaster won, then the Collector would live, but if he lost, then he too would also die. The Grandmaster and Death each selected teams from among Earth’s superhumans to do battle in a contest of champions. The Grandmaster’s team won, but Death revealed in order to bring the Collector to life, the Grandmaster would have to forfeit his own life. Compelled by his sense of gamesmanship to see the game through to its end, the Grandmaster died and the Collector returned to life. |||| |||| However, Death then challenged the Collector to a game, apparently with the resurrection of the Grandmaster as the stakes. The outcome of the game is unknown, but the Collector is known to have survived and the Grandmaster has been seen since. The Grandmaster then used the Avengers and an incarnation of the Legion of the Unliving in another contest against Death, in which he won immortality for himself and all of the Elders. |||| |||| Later the Elders of the Universe plotted to kill Galactus by using the Infinity Gems against him. This plan failed and the Elders were then confronted by a power seeking Thanos. The Grandmaster lost one of the gems in the process, and Thanos gained ultimate power shortly thereafter. |||| |||| Recently, the Grandmaster has been seen reuniting the Squadron Sinister, and only he knows what games are yet to come."

In addition to more complex or subtle operations, he can channel his power into basic feats such as defensive screen or blasts of tremendous force.",,"Vance Astrovik was a normal teen who found himself secretly protected by the Guardians of the Galaxy, a group of superheroes from an alternate future who feared Vance was a target of the villainous Korvac. Upon meeting Vance Astro, the Guardian who happened to be an alternate-future version of himself, Vance experienced a mental shock that caused his mutant powers to emerge. |||| |||| Vance had often been abused by his father throughout his childhood, but his powers led to more abuse from his father, a violent anti-mutant bigot. Vance soon ran away from home and eventually ended up adventuring alongside the Thing, who was taking a leave of absence from the Fantastic Four. Calling himself Marvel Boy, Astrovik joined the Thing as a member of the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation before finally parting ways. |||| |||| Vance, as Marvel Boy, later tried to join the Avengers, but was told by his hero, Captain America, that he needed more experience. Feeling rejected and embarrassed, Vance was then approached by Night Thrasher and Nova, who were forming their own team called the New Warriors. Vance quickly became one of the Warriors' most stalwart members and met fellow mutant Firestar, with whom he developed a romantic relationship. |||| |||| Returning home for a brief period, Vance was struck again by his father, and, when retaliating with his powers, Vance killed him. His mother pressed charges, and Vance was arrested, serving time for murder. Later released for good behavior, Vance adopted a new guise as Justice, and rejoined the New Warriors, often serving in leadership roles. Firestar eventually asked Vance to marry her. |||| |||| Vance and Firestar, alongside their teammate Rage, were drawn into conflict with monsters summoned by evil sorceress Morgan Le Fay. Rage, once a member of the Avengers, brought the couple with him as the Avengers reassembled after a period of disbanding to defeat Le Fey. After a strong push to prove himself, Vance, with Firestar, were elected reserve members. |||| |||| After serving several missions, and feeling vastly inferior to be joining the same league as his idols, Vance was elected to full membership. Continually trying to prove himself, Justice eventually won over his insecurities during the Avengers' battle with the robot Ultron. He had researched the Avengers files, discovering a new means of defeating Ultron and using it to help the Avengers destroy him. After seeing the emotional turmoil Hank Pym and the Wasp went through in the battle, Vance finally began to regard the Avengers as people rather than icons and became more relaxed about working with the team. |||| |||| Soon afterward, Vance announced his engagement with Firestar, and the two left active duty, presumably to explore their relationship. In reality, they were asked to secretly infiltrate the headquarters of the Triune Understanding, whose leader, Jonathan Tremont, was surreptitiously attacking the Avengers' public image for his own benefit. Vance and Firestar discovered the true cause of the Understanding-- using the beliefs of its members to sympathetically power a spaceship to battle a cosmic menace. They helped a contingent of Avengers join the battle against the menace, and directly afterwards helped the heroes keep the time-travelling Kang from conquering the world. After the crises were averted, they again parted company with the Avengers. |||| |||| Vance settled into civilian life with relative ease, as much as a public trial, a Dateline special, and four books written about him could allow, although Firestar had a rough transition settling into college studies at Empire State University. Vance was eagerly awaiting the next stage in his life, their upcoming marriage, but Firestar was reluctant. After a heart-to-heart, the couple agreed to call off the wedding, and even the status of their relationship remains uncertain. |||| |||| During the Civil War he fought alongside Captain America, but after the war he joined the Initiative training camp where he became an instructor. Vance is currently, though secretly, seeing Ultragirl."

As Oracle, she was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix Lilandra from her insane brother, then-Majestor D'Ken. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor. |||| |||| The Guard and the X-Men subsequently clashed once more when the Shi'ar sought to end the threat to the universe posed by the cosmic entity known as the Phoenix, which had assumed the form of X-Men member Jean Grey. As the Guard's only telepathic member at the time, Oracle was an obvious choice to be one of eight Guardsmen chosen to battle the X-Men. The Guard defeated the X-Men on this occasion, but the mutants were allowed to return to Earth after Phoenix seemingly committed suicide. |||| |||| Soon after, Oracle was amongst those few Imperial Guard members who opposed the treacherous Shi'ar High Council member Lord Samédàr who was aiding an attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by Deathbird. Even after many of the Guard chose to side with Samédàr, Oracle remained steadfast in her loyalty to then-Empress Lilandra. |||| |||| Later, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne, Oracle was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as Excalibur and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named Rachel Summers. |||| |||| Much later, the intergalactic teleporter Lila Cheney transported the X-Men to the Shi'ar Empire at the behest of then-Empress Deathbird in time to see Lilandra regain her throne. Not all was as it seemed, however, as in reality a group of Warskrulls, using technology to allow them to duplicate superpowers, had captured and impersonated the X-Men's founder, the telepathic Professor Charles Xavier, using his telepathy to control Lilandra and the Imperial Guard including Oracle, whose own telepathic powers were no match for Xavier's. After the ruse was discovered by the X-Men and all the Warskrull impostors were exposed, Lilandra settled matters with Deathbird, discovering her sister did not want the throne anymore. |||| |||| During the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires, Oracle was part of a small team of Guardsmen who were charged with discovering the whereabouts of the powerful Kree weapon known as the Omni-Wave Projector. Oracle's team captured the Earthling named Rick Jones, a long-time ally of the former Kree soldier known as Captain Mar-vell, and learned of the location of the device by scanning Jones' mind. |||| |||| When the Empress Lilandra, having regained her throne, learned of the many Earth heroes that had sacrificed their lives to stop the malevolent psionic being named Onslaught, she dispatched eight members of the Imperial Guard, including Oracle, to protect Earth. While on Earth, the Guard uncovered a plot by a militant Kree faction to simulate a radical political activist group in revenge for Earth's involvement in the Kree/Shi'ar war. In reality, the group created a 'nega-reactor', similar to the bomb that was used on the Kree. However, this plot was stopped by the Guard, but not before the reactor was used by the Kree's leader, the Supreme Intelligence, to re-incorporate itself after being presumably killed at the end of the war. |||| |||| During their brief stay on Earth, Oracle and her fellow Guardsman Gladiator learned that a fugitive from Shi'ar justice was hiding on the planet, stuck in the form of a child and with no memory of his former life. Their search brought them into confrontation with the gamma-spawned man-beast known as the incredible Hulk. |||| |||| In her time as a member of the Imperial Guard, Oracle and her fellow Guardsman Flashfire had fallen in love and planned to marry. She took the opportunity to retire from active duty with the Guard, and her place was taken by the telepath named Delphos. |||| |||| For reasons unknown, Oracle's relationship with Flashfire did not last, and she later returned as a member of the Imperial Guard following the mental possession of their Empress Lilandra by Charles Xavier's mutant twin sister Cassandra Nova and her decree that all mutants on Earth had to be destroyed, starting with the X-Men. Oracle's appearance had changed drastically - instead of the refined, well-kept woman she once was, Oracle now appears as a naked, feral harridan. During the ensuing clash, Oracle was defeated by the group of young telepaths known as the Stepford Cuckoos, whose combined mental abilities proved more powerful than Oracle's own. ||||"

Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor. |||| |||| Later, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne from her sister, Lilandra, Midget was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as Excalibur and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named Rachel Summers. |||| |||| During the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires, Midget - now using her new Guardsman codename of Scintilla - was part of a small team of Guardsmen who were charged with preventing the member of the Earth team of super-powered beings known as the Avengers named Quasar from retrieving the legendary Nega-Bands of the Kree warrior Captain Mar-vell, which had been stolen. ||||"

He can shoot lasers from his wings, and the wings can be used as a bombproof shield. He has titanium claws on his gloves and his visor gives him infrared and telescopic vision.",,"Kyle Richmond lived a privileged life of luxury, making him spoiled, irresponsible, and insubordinate. His irresponsibility led to tragedy, however, when he drove drunk and caused an accident that killed his girlfriend. He sought refuge in being drafted for the army, but he was rejected when a physical revealed he had a heart murmur. He threw himself into his life of luxury, all the while secretly searching for a cure. Finding a mysterious formula in an ancient book, Kyle re-created and drank it, discovering his body gained superhuman powers, but only at night. |||| |||| The Grandmaster immediately appeared, revealing that it was he who arranged for Kyle to find the formula. The Grandmaster then had him take the identity of Nighthawk in order to form the Squadron Sinister and fight the Avengers, who themselves were pawns of the Grandmaster’s opponent, Kang the Conqueror. Although the Squadron was defeated, the Grandmaster kept his word and returned Kyle and the others to Earth with their powers. Kyle continued to use his Nighthawk identity for idle amusement, running into conflict with Daredevil. |||| |||| A few months later, he and the other members of the Squadron Sinister were hired by the alien geographer, Nebulon. Nebulon and the Squadron Sinister tried to melt the polar ice caps, but Nighthawk grew uncomfortable with the situation and, acting responsibly for the first time in his life, he contacted the Defenders to help defeat the Squadron. In the conflict, Nighthawk threw himself in front of Nebulon’s laser cannon, stopping the plot at the risk of his life. Doctor Strange cast a spell to revive Nighthawk, and Kyle became an associate of the team. |||| |||| Nighthawk found a new sense of purpose as a member of the Defenders. He updated his costume with a jet-powered glider and turned his private riding academy into a team headquarters. He even became a de facto leader of the group, serving faithfully except for a brief period when he retired his identity to deal with an IRS investigation. Later, after stopping the demonic Six-Fingered Hand, the spell Doctor Strange had used to revive Nighthawk was disrupted. Kyle found himself completely paralyzed during the day, having his superpowers and full mobility only at night. |||| |||| Kyle tried to return to college, where he found his former girlfriend, Mindy Williams, had not died during their earlier accident but was severely crippled. Mindy was, in fact, a telepath, and she tried to gain revenge on Nighthawk, who was saved with the help of Spider-Man. Soon after, Nighthawk learned Mindy was an unwilling tool of August Masters, a super-patriot who hoped to use the collective psychic might of Mindy and other telepaths to attack the Soviet Union. He contacted the Defenders to help defeat masters, although it was the six telepaths, funneling their collective power into Nighthawk, that were able to destroy the complex. Although the Defenders escaped, Kyle, the telepaths, and Masters were all inside when it exploded. |||| |||| Kyle was hospitalized and believed dead, but it was soon discovered he was in fact in a coma, when he recuperated faster when blocked from the sun’s rays during the day. During his time in a coma, Kyle was approached by an angelic being that told Nighhawk his role on Earth was far from over. When Kyle awoke, he possessed a special psychic vision that allowed him to perceive evil deeds before they would occur, and Nighthawk resumed his crime-fighting career by taking a proactive approach to defeat crime before it happened. This crusade, however, had all the seeming of a costumed man beating up innocent people, and Daredevil, rightfully concerned, confronted Nighthawk. Although Nighthawk tried to recruit Daredevil, both were killed in a subsequent conflict. In fact, this was all according to Mephisto’s plan, who had posed as the angel giving Nighthawk his new vision and purpose, knowing that Kyle was on his way to a better afterlife and was determined to stop him. Nighthawk, by force of will, dragged Daredevil with him physically out of hell and back into the land of the living, thwarting Mephisto’s plans. |||| |||| Kyle sought help from Papa Hagg to remove Mephisto’s influence, and he kept his Nighthawk costume at the ready. Finally, after a long hiatus, the Defenders were reunited after his former teammate Hellcat brought the original founders together to defeat Yandroth the Magician. As a result of the battle, several of the Defenders were cursed to continually band together, and Nighthawk and the remaining Defenders elected to stay together as a team to support them. Nighthawk, in particular, was thrilled to once again be a part of the team. He had Papa Hagg magically transport the support Defenders whenever the core team would be cursed to appear at a trouble spot. However, as part of the curse, the core Defenders found themselves distancing themselves from humanity. They finally struck upon the idea that in order to have peace, they would enforce it by ruling the world. Nighthawk and the support Defenders organized a team to defeat the so-called Order, after which the Defenders were freed from their curse but disbanded once again. |||| |||| Recently, Nighthawk began to notice that his superhuman powers were steadily increasing. About the same time, a division of Richmond Enterprises was robbed by former Squadron member Speed Demon, prompting Nighthawk to seek him out. Speed Demon was actually performing robberies in order to fund his new team, the Thunderbolts. Nighthawk confronted Speed Demon, but they were in turn confronted by a revived Squadron Sinister, who took Nighthawk and Speed Demon away with them. The Squadron hoped to take over the world in order to better solve the world’s problems, but they were stopped by the Thunderbolts. Speed Demon hoped to trick the Squadron into thinking he would help them, but he turned on them, helping the Thunderbolts force them to escape. Nevertheless, Songbird ultimately kicked Speed Demon out of the Thunderbolts because of his previous robberies, claiming that what the Thunderbolts needed more were members whose hearts were behind their efforts to reform. She then invited Nighthawk to join them, and he agreed. However, it wasn’t long before the Thunderbolts were rejoined by Baron Zemo, and Nighthawk decided to quit rather than work with the former criminal. (It was also revealed that Songbird only wanted Nighthawk as a member to help fund the team.) |||| Nighthawk returned to the Squadron Sinister, who preferred to be called Supreme Power, finding them again recruited by the Grandmaster. This time, the Grandmaster claimed that the stakes of the game would affect the entire universe, and he hoped to use the Squadron to find the Wellspring of Power, from which he drew upon to grant the Squadron their abilities."

3887,Ms. Marvel (Marvel)(01 - Carol Danvers),Carol Susan Jane Danvers. ,3887_20070317132831_char.jpg,"Ms. Marvel has a wide array of superhuman powers. Initially they included superhuman strength, endurance, formidable resistance to physical injury, the ability to fly, and a precognitive sense. |||| |||| When she became Binary, she could manipulate every form of energy in the electromagnetic spectrum on a cosmic level, had vastly increased strength, and could fly at speeds exceeding light. After her link to the white hole from which she drew her powers was severed, she lost the bulk of her cosmic powers, but still retained her energy manipulation powers on a smaller scale. In addition to her original powers of superhuman strength, injury resistance, and flight, Ms. Marvel has the ability to absorb and manipulate photonic energy. She can focus her photonic powers into explosive blasts of radiant energy, which she fires from her fingertips. These blasts are comparable in power to her fellow Avenger Iron Man's repulsor rays. By focusing her powers outward in all directions, she can surround herself with an energy aura which deflects most attacks. She also has some gravitational powers which allow her to boost her already tremendous strength by absorbing the gravitational forces around her. She has also demonstrated the ability to absorb other forms of energy, such as electricity, to further magnify her strength and energy projection. On at least one occasion, Binary was able to use her power to force open a Shi'ar Stargate, a feat which only hosts of the Phoenix Force and Firestar have managed before or since. |||| |||| Originally, Hank McCoy, aka the Beast, after performing several biological tests, had theorized Ms. Marvel would never be able to access her cosmic level powers again. However, recent events have proven this to be incorrect. It has been confirmed as of New Avengers #17 and #18 that Ms. Marvel still possesses all the abilities she had as Binary, and merely lacks a suitable power supply. One might then surmize that her abilities to absorb and manipulate energy have no upper limit. This was confirmed when Ms. Marvel battled the sentient energy being known as The Collective and was stuck by a bolt of its energy, causing her skin to turn fiery red, which was a side effect of her cosmic powers. In addition, the flaming energy corona that manifested around her head when she used them also appeared.",,None entered.
